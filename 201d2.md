# Day 2 Lecture/Reading Notes

12/6 lecture notes

No code challenge today, but we will be doing those on Mondays from now on. 

If A veteran, you do get some free tutoring every month. 
Shes going over the upcoming assignments for the week. 

Do not forget about your career attend a meetup and your career talk to your network assignments. 
Quizzes are for you to see how you are learning. They are open book, with unlimited retakes, as well as open internet. Mostly multiple choice. A lot of the questions in the quizzes are found again on the final exam. But the final exam does not word them the same way, so you need to make sure you understand the material in the quizzes. 
Code Review. Very helpful. Opens up our code and the class reviews and gets asked questions about it. 
Will be doing code challenges in repl. Remember that when using JS the first line of code you always put in is ‘use strict’; 
Then start with proof of life with console log, then check the console to make sure that everything is working as expected.
Class two material is available to us now on class repo.  
Primitive data types: 
Strings, Boolean, integer/number, objects, arrays, etc…
What are data types? A type of data….. a way of formatting data that the computer can understand and anticipate. 
Primitives: they are the building blocks of more complex data types or structures. They are the more basic form of data. These include numbers, Boolean, strings
In JS, a number is the numeric datatype, can be a decimal and can be a negative. 
Booleans are the logical data type, can only be true or false. 
Strings: can be a sequence of characters that we use to represent text. Can be letters numbers symbols or combinations of them. They are denoted in JS by quotations. 
Two other data types are also technically primitives: 
Undefined: a primitive value that is assigned to a variable when no other value is assigned. Example: “let username;” where username would undefined. 
Null: Specifically defines as none; nothing or null. Ex. ‘let username =null’;
Prompt will ALWAYS return a value that has a string data type. So if you want to do anything with it like it were a number, you would have to do something with the prompt after that. 
JavaScript: “everything in JavaScript is an object”. Which is kinda true if you look under the hood. So if you were going to get null data type, you will get an object datatype instead. 
In JS, us \ as an escape character. 
ParseInt: turns a string into a number if you put in a number. Lets you add numbers in JS without getting messed up. 
If you do parseInt on a string, it will return NaN (not a number). Ironically, NaN is considered a number by JavaScript.

### Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)

First few pages are review from 101 and 102, going over paragraph, bold, italic, and headings 
sup and sub elements are used to denote super or sub scripts. 

In order to make code easier to read, often times developers put in extra space. However, line breaks, extra spaces are treated as a singel space when displayed on a browser. Which is why my notes for day one looked like a massive walll of text. <br />

br / can be used to create a line break <br /> 
hr / can be used to create a horizontal line across the page, useful when separating out different themed topcics on a page <hr /><br />

**When using HTML, do NOT use elements like em or blockquote to display the content of those tags in a different way. Instead, use the tages to discribe the content of your page more accurately.** <br />

Strong denotes that the content inside of the element has strong importance <br />

em indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentance. <br />

Quotations can be done using blockquote or q, with blockquote being for larger quotes that are their own standalone paragraph, and q being used for smaller quotes that sit within another paragraph. <br />

abbr element is used to denote an abbreviation <br />

cite element is used to denote a peice of text as a citation or a reference <br />

dfn element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term, where defining instance is the first time you explain some new terminology <br />

address element is used to contain contact information for the author of the page. <br />

ins is used to show content that has been inserted into a document, where del is used to show content that has been removed from a document. <br /> 

s element is used to indicate that something is no longer accurate, but should not be deleted. Think old prices of items that now on sale. <br />

Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245) 

Recall that block level elements appear to start on a new line, while inline elements flow within the text and do not. <br />
CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box and its contents are presented. <br />

\<body> \<h1> \<h2> \<p> \<i> \<a> each create their own box. <br />

Selectors indicate which element a CSS rule applies to, and declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Multiple selectors can be used for a rule if the element names are separated with a comma. <br />
Declarations are broken into two parts, a property and a value. <br />
Properties are the aspects you want to change, and the values are the exact settings you want to have for those changed aspects. <br />
Link element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS filed used to style the page. <br />
href specifies the path to the CSS file<br /> 
type attribute specifies the type of document being linked to, in the case of external CSS links, the vale should be /css<br /> 
rel specifies the relationship between the html page and the file it is linked to. 
Internal CSS rules can be used inside of an HTML page by placing them inside of a style element. Don't really want to do this, and when building a site with more than one page you <strong> really </strong> want to used external CSS. <br />

**Selectors** 
They allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document. they are case sensitive, and much match element names/values exactly. 
- universal: applies to all elements in the document
- type: matches element names
- class: matches an element whose class attribute has a value that matches the one specified after the period (or full stop) sybol. 
- id: matches an element whose id attribute has a value thatmatches the one specified after the pound or hash symbol. 
- Child: matches an element thatis a direct child of another. 
- descendent selector: matches an element thatis a descendent of another specified element. 
- Adjacent sibling selector: matches an element that is the next sibling of another
- General Sibling Selector: matches an element that is a sibling of another, although it does not have to be the directly preceding element.
<br />
Note: if two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence. if one selector is more specific than the others, then the more specific one will take precedence over the others. 
<br />
Inheritance: If you specify a property on an element, then the children of that element will also have that same property, this is to save you time so you dont have to go through and apply that to all of the children of that element <br />

# JavaScript Reading

Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)

Statements are individual instructions and end with a ;
<br />
 single line comments are // and multi line comments start with /* and end with */. <br />

 Variables review from 102. 
 Variable keyword is var, and you must first name a variable before you give it a value 
 <br />
 data types: See lecture notes. remember that numbers are not stored inside of quotations. 

Rules for naming variables :
<br />
1. cannot start with a number.
2. cannot have a dash or period in name.
3. cannot use keywords or reserved words. 
4. all variables are case sensitive. 
5. name should describe the type of information held by the variable.
6. use camel casing where appropriate.
<br />

Arrays stor lists of values, and should be used when working with a list or a set of values that are related to one another. Array literals are preferred over array constructors. 
<br />
the numbering of a list of values in an array starts at zero, NOT one, ie, the index starts at zero.
