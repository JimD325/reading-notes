# Day 8 Reading Notes 

Class 8 Readings 



Web API design best practices - Azure Architecture Center | Microsoft Docs
1.	What does REST stand for? Representational State Transfer, it is an architectural approach to designing web services. It is independent of other protocols, and not necessarily tied to HTTP, but must REST API implementations use HTTP as the application protocol. 
2.	REST APIs are designed around a resource, which is any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client. 
3.	What is an identifier of a resource? A URI which is responsible for uniquely identifying only that resource. https://adventure-works.com/orders/1 . A URI can be just a name by itself, or a name with a protocol that tells you how to reach it. Once that protocol is reached and has the name, it is a URL. Exapmple: google.com is a URI, because it has only the name of the resource. https://google.com is a URL, because it has the name of the resource(google.com) and the way to get there (https://).  
4.	What are the most common HTTP verbs? GET, POST, PUT, Patch, and Delete. 
5.	What should the URIs be based on? Nouns, or the resource itself. Verbs are the operations on the resource. 
6.	Give an example of a good URI. https://adventure-works.com/orders, where the order is the noun. You want to avoid using https://adventure-works.com/create-order as a best practice. You should also use plural nounes for items the reference collections, which is just a collection of resources.  
7.	What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? A chatty API is one which exposes a large number of smaller resources. These can require a client application to send multiple requests to find all the data that is required. Is this a good or a bad thing? This should be balanced with combining related information into larger resources that can be gathered with a single request. However, these both need to be balanced because you don’t want to fetch data the client doesn’t need, as this can increase the latency of a request and increase bandwidth usage. 
8.	What status code does a successful GET request return? 200 (OK)
9.	What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return? 404 (not found)
10.	What status code does a successful POST request return? 201 (created)
11.	What status code does a successful DELETE request return? 204 (No Content)
-	GET retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.
-	POST creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources.
-	PUT either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.
-	PATCH performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.
-	DELETE removes the resource at the specified URI.




# Day 8 Lecture Notes 

## 5/16 Lecture Notes

- Do not just turn in "placeholder". Make sure you actually turn in an assignment even if it is not completed, and then follow up on it. <br/>
- Async: prevents our function from stopping while it waits for a response from axios. 
- server: processes requests from and generates responses for a client. 
- REST: representational state transfer. 
- GET = READ, get is a REST protocol. 
- REST are a set of guidlines that all APIs should abide by if you want the majority of the internet to interact with it. 
- Express: the environment in which we build our server. It provides the framework that runs on node.js that allows us to build a server that runs in the browser. 
- Application Middleware: Bridge software that fills any gaps that an application has in order to run. Examples are security/vulnerabilities related, like when you are visiting your banking website and your credentials getcached and a bad actor disguised as a good website can steal your info. 
- Cors: Bodyguard of the internet.  
- Route Middleware: Basically its just CORS. 
- env Variables: a file that hides your API keys from GitHub/hackers, make sure you add the .env to your .gitignore. 
- use try/catch for error handling on the back end. 

### Now we start with Regex: 

- don't feel like you have to memorize any of it. Know how to look it up, but its readability is zilch. These are patterns taht help programmers match, search, and replace text. 
- Can use it to target the things you dont want (or do want) to include. 
- Regex is a way to identify patters in strings. We commonly use it to validate input. 
- Make sure you google regex for the language that you are coding in, there are differences between them. 
- regex101 is the way to go. You MUST change the flavor to ECMAScript first. 

### 5/17 Lecture Notes
- API: holds the data and sends it in a request object. 
- We need a server thatlets us talk to the rest of the internet and is responsible for sending/reciving requests and responses. code in servers are easy to find through the borwser, therefore a server is a great place to store API keys. 
- What do we keep in our .env file: anything we want confidential, API keys, other variables that will ink to your server URL. 
- nodemon: helps develop node.JS automatically restart application after a change is made. It is a dev dependency, meaning its there to help you. Stands for no demon. ONLY time you have to restart it is if you change your `.env` file. Install: `npm install --save-dev nodemon` NOT INSTALLED GLOBALLY, each ap needs you to put it in if you want it. 
- you can see it in package lock
- to start your server: `npx nodemon server.js`
- Do all APIs require a key? No. 
- A Form Group bootstrap component is needed when you need a control ID. 
- you use a control ID to grab the value of whatever is inside of it. 

### 5/18 Lecture Notes 
- Doug Code review
- Has to search twice to get lat long, but thats a separate error
- error code 500: something happened on the weather API on the backend. 
- Go to host 3001, then the endpoit of /weatherData?city
- You have one response.send in one function, but one function can invoke all of them at once if the individual functions have response.send in them. <br/>
- have to drill down to weatherResponse.data.data
- Heroku deployment, check class 8 repo and the class slack channel. Only thing due tonight is the RETRO! DO IT. Schedule a one on one with Hexx when you get the opportunity. Should be scheduled within the next seven days and totally done by next wednesday. 
- tomorrow is code challenge 8 code review. 
- friday night there is a circle back at 630 for bootstrap, DO NOT FORGET. 630 to 8PM at the latest. 
- environment in netlify is the same as config vars in heroku. 
- If heroku is serving the application, we dont need to pass in the PORT to heroku (for lab 8).
