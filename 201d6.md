# Notes 

### 12/20/2021 lecture notes

- starts with a code review. of Lab 5a. 
- You can call a fucntion inside of the parameters of another function, and can call the same function inside of itself. 

#### Flexbox 
___ 
You can use float to move boxes where you want them to go. However, float has some limitations, mostly in that it can result in the display of the website getting messed up. <br /> 
Display allows for similar things to float, with different limitations. For example, different amounts of content lead to the boxes not being even. You can then set the width to a minimum so all the boxes are the same size. <br /> 

Flexbox came around in 2015ish. <br /> 
Flex looks at things in terms of the flex container and the flex items. So always know what the items are and what the container is. <br /> 
display: flex; causes all items in the container to be reated as flex items. Will cause the boxes to automatically be the same size within the container. 
- you can center all items inside of the flexbox using the justify-content: center: command.<br />  
- Look up flex box stuff for this. <br />
- she recommends using the cheat sheet she put in the notes. 
- there are a bunch of things within flexbox, and it looks pretty powerful. Use it. 

### Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)
---
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model. in an object, variables and functions take on new names. 
- In an object, variables are called properties. 
- if a function is part of an object, it is called a method. 
<br /> 
Properties tell us about the object, and methods represent tasks that are associated with the object. <br /> 
properties and methods have a name and a value, and the name is referred to as a key. <br /> 
Creating an Object: 
Literal notation is the easiest way. <br /> 
The object is the curly braces and all their contents. <br /> 
keys are separated from their values using colons, and properties and methods are separated using commas. <br /> 
to access a property or method you use the name of the object, then a period, then the name of the property or method you want to aaccess.
