# Notes 

### 12/20/2021 lecture notes

- starts with a code review. of Lab 5a. 
- You can call a fucntion inside of the parameters of another function, and can call the same function inside of itself. 

#### Flexbox 
___ 
You can use float to move boxes where you want them to go. However, float has some limitations, mostly in that it can result in the display of the website getting messed up. <br /> 
Display allows for similar things to float, with different limitations. For example, different amounts of content lead to the boxes not being even. You can then set the width to a minimum so all the boxes are the same size. <br /> 

Flexbox came around in 2015ish. <br /> 
Flex looks at things in terms of the flex container and the flex items. So always know what the items are and what the container is. <br /> 
display: flex; causes all items in the container to be reated as flex items. Will cause the boxes to automatically be the same size within the container. 
- you can center all items inside of the flexbox using the justify-content: center: command.<br />  
- Look up flex box stuff for this. <br />
- she recommends using the cheat sheet she put in the notes. 
- there are a bunch of things within flexbox, and it looks pretty powerful. Use it. 

12/21 Lecture Notes<br />
630PM<br />
keep track of what branch you are deploying to GitHub. <br />
This is where class difficulty begins to really take off<br />
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE CODE YOU ARE WRITING. YOU need to know what is actually happening. <br /> 
Write down timestamps of when material in lectuer is being covered so you can reference later if you have questions about important topics. <br />

In 301/401 there is alot more pair programming assignments. Group projects will be more common in the last two weeks of this class. <br />
We will also be starting one on ones. <br /> 
So tomorrow there is an instructor sync meeting, and you will talk with sheyna about the class tomorrow during lab. <br />

Today we will be getting into objects. <br />
640<br />
Why is an object useful to us? 

You declare an object in a similar fashion to an array, but by using curly brackets to hold the object. <br />
A value of a key in an object can be any data type, including another object.<br />
"under the hood", everything in JS is basically an object. This includes arrays.<br />
When referring to a key in a given object, you can use this.key to give you value of the key. <br />
706<br />
Begins talking about DOM (document ___ model). You can manipulate its properties. <br />
You can add to an object OUTSIDE of the {} of the object. You have to assign the value of the new key using =. <br />
712 <br />
DOM manipulation. <br />
DOM is your browsers interpretation of the HTML to help build it out into a page. <br />
Use link to attach CSS to an HTML file. link href="". link your CSS reset first., then your style.css <br />
To attach the JS into the document, use a script tag on the very bottom just above the ending body tag. <br /> 
In the kitten adoption page she did, she then says we will need to have a way for the website to update as new cats come in. "render dynamically" she calls it.  <br />

743 she lost me. Kitten Container? It was right after the break. <br />

Step 
1. Create element. 
  She created an article and assigned it the value of document.createElement(), and passed the value of the element she wanted to create, which was in this case an article. <br />
2. give it content<br />
3. append it to the dom. <br />

Created Elements have to be a string, so use ''. <br />
<br />
811 Using a for loop to iterate an array 

Dont worry about query selectors just yet. There are five store locations, she recommends to pick one and start there. IE start with seattle and get it right, then do it for all the other cities.

### Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)
---
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model. in an object, variables and functions take on new names. 
- In an object, variables are called properties. 
- if a function is part of an object, it is called a method. 
<br /> 
Properties tell us about the object, and methods represent tasks that are associated with the object. <br /> 
properties and methods have a name and a value, and the name is referred to as a key. <br /> 
Creating an Object: 
Literal notation is the easiest way. <br /> 
The object is the curly braces and all their contents. <br /> 
keys are separated from their values using colons, and properties and methods are separated using commas. <br /> 
to access a property or method you use the name of the object, then a period, then the name of the property or method you want to aaccess. 

Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)

Doc Object Model (DOM) is separate from HTML and JS, and has it own set of rules. It: 
1. Makes a model of the HTML page using a DOM tree.
2. acceses and changes the HTML page. 

The DOM Tree is a model of a web page, there is a great picture of it on 187. <br />
When you access any element, attribute, or text node, you navigate to it via the document node. <br />
Once you find the element you want, then you can access its text and attribute nodes if you want to. 
- document node: represents the entire page as well as the document object. 
<br />
Working with the dom tree:  Accessing/updating the DOM tree has two steps:
1. Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with 
2. Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 
To access the elements: 
- you can select an infividual element node by using getElementById(), querySelector. 
- You can select multiple elements (nodelists) by getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName() and querySelectorAll(). <br />
The terms elements and nodes are used interchangeably, but when the DOM is working with an element, it is actually working with a NODE which represents that element. <br />

Dom Queries: Methods thatfind elements in the DOM tree are called DOM queries. When you are working with an element more than once, you should Store result of the query. The element stored in the variable is actually stored in the DOM tree in a variable. 

### Accessing Elements

Dom Queries may return one element or a nodelist, which is a collection of nodes. <br />
If a method CAN return more than one node, it will always return a nodelist, even if it only finds one matching element. 
- getElementById('id') selects an individual element given the value of its ID attribute. HTML must have an id attribute in order for it to be selectable. 
- querySelector('css selector') uses css selector syntax that would select one or more elements. <br />
- getElementsByClassName('class') selects one or more elements given the value of their class atrribute. 
- getElementsByTagName('tagName') selects all elements on the page with the specified tag name. 
Methods that Select Individual Elements:<br />
getElementById() and querySelector() can both search an entire document and return individual elements. <br />
Nodelists: <br />
Nodelists appear to be similar to arrays, but they are in fact a collection type of object. Length property tells you how many items are in the NodeList. <br />
Selecting an element from a NodeList: 
1. Item Method: Select elements with whichever method you are using. Then use length property to determine how many elements were found and not to run code if there are zero found. Store the element from the NodeList with index of i in a variable. 
2. Array Syntax: it is preferred, and identical to the item method, it just uses square brackets with the index of interest inside them. 
<br />
Repeating Actions for an entire NodeList: 
- when you have a Nodelist, you can loop through each node in the collection and apply the same statements to each. Create a variable which contains a NodeList, run a For loop for the length of the NodeList, and then apply the code you are looking to implement. <br />
206-207 a great diagram of the step by step looping through a nodelist. <br />

When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using 5 properties: 
1. parentNode: this property finds the element node for the containig/parent element in the html. 
2. previousSibling/nextSibling: these properties find the previous or next sibling of a node if there are siblings. 
3. first/lastChild: these properties find the first or last child of the current element.<br /> 
These are properties of the current node and therefore do not need parentheses, would need them if there were methods to select an element. <br />
All browsers except IE add a text node whenever they come across whitespace between elements <br />

How to Get/Update Element Content:

When you select a text node, you can retrive or amend the content of it using the nodeValue property. <br />
example access of a text node: 
document.getElementById('one').firstChild.nextSibling.nodeValue;<br />

- textContent: allowsy ou to collect or update just the text that is in the containing element (and its children). 

Adding/Removing HTML Content: 
There are two methods: 
1. inner HTML: Can be used on any element node, and is used to retrieve and to replace content. Better suited to updating whole fragments. 
  - first step is to create a variable holding markup. 
  - 2nd step is to select element whose content you want to update.
  - 3rd step is to update the content of selecter element with new markup. 
2. DOM manipulation Methods: easily targets individual nodes in the DOM tree. 
- create new text node
- create new element node
- add text node to element node 
- select element you want to add the new fragment to. 
- append the new fragment to the selected element. 
<br />
Elements can also be removed via DOM manipulation.
