- we must use bracket notation to access a value of a property if we dont know the name of it. 
- Object.keys(): takes in an object as an arguement and returns an array of keys(or properties)
- syntax: Object.keys(obj); 
- input: the object of which the enumerables own proeprties are to be returned. 
- output: array of strings that represent all the enumerable properties of the given object. 
- chained methods: Object.keys(instructor).forEach(value => stuff)
<br/><br/><br/>

-  Object.values: returns an iterable array of just the values from the object. 

- input: object whose enumerated own property values are to be returned. 
- output: an array containing the given objects own enumerable property values. 

- Object.Entries: returns an array of each "Entry" as an array with a key and values. 

## 5/20 lecture notes

Modules are similar to components but for the back end. <br/>
Node modules are what we are working on today. <br/>
Debugging is a very difficult thing to do well, but it is an important skill, especially with other peoples code since you would likely have to do that in industry. <br/>
Community night next friday, will help you pimp out your github profile. <br/>
Code review for lab 8 at 928<br/>.
Starts on the backend first. <br/>.  
adding in error handling around 938. <br/>
Next is added by express, and is a server method. It takes the error, then passes it to cors, our middle ware. cors handles the error, then sends info to us wrapped up by cors. <br/>
Zayah runs into error for 3001 port, then to get around it runs to the 3002 port to address it. It worked at 942am<br/>.
You check for errors in the server by opoening up the thunder client inside of VS. <br/>
moves on to movies at 944am<br/>
Very similar to weather, Z used split to return only the city by using split to separate by a comma. <br/>
Zaya did a very good job according to hexx, way to go z!<br/> 
at 948 hexx has Z add a URL for the image of the movie. The example response is the information that they want you to send back to REACT, NOT everything you get from the API. <br/>
To add URL, there is a base url you have to add to the start of poster path to get to the image. `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500`+movie.poster_path<br/>
Derek didnt like the documentation on the movie API at 953 ish. During this conversation zayah is updating the state of getMovies thru 955, rewatch this part, updating JSX in state which Hexx hasnt seen much of before.<br/>
Troubleshooting handle error at 959, data is coming in as undefined. Putting await infront of this.handleError(error) didnt fix it at 1003. Changed back port that the server was running on due to recurring issue. This did not fix the error issue, but moved on at 1005. <br/>

- Mistakes were made, do it right the first time, read whole thing below before going forward.
Putting up at 1008 to heroku<br/>
Connect via github option is broken, so you have to use the code lines below. commands put in around 1013A. <br/>
1. create heroku remote: heroku git:remove -a `<name>`<br/>
Accidentally put react app on heroku instead of api. git remote remove heroku inside of react app fixes it. Then switch to api, reattach heroku remote at 1016A. Trouble shooting this for a few minutes. 
- trying again around 1017. <br/>
- still trouble shooting as of 1021 <br/>
- need to add node.js buildpack to properly push up our stuff, as well as node.js framework in heroku. 
- git push heroku mai

- back at 1135. Going over notes in the readme. 
- done at 1141. 
- at 1144 codestack:Think bout it like janga blocks, the best way to take out of it would be top down. A drawing showing how the callstack relates to city-explorer api is made in miro. app.get runs to axios to get the url.  
- pretty fascinating bit here, watch it in full. its called the event loop. switches to replit demo at 1151. 
- you can use promises in react now, could try it out. 
- the benefit of this is wrapped up in moduality, which we will go over later. 
- set timeout is literally just a timer. 
- Still in replit at 1104, still confused, rewatch.
- will not use promise at all in the lab today, but save it for later 1107A
- break at 1110
-  refactoring replit start at 1124.
- bad code at 1128 references the same code more than once. 
- refactoring is done to make it better. We want to cahce a reference to it, just once.  
- refactor it a few times, ended with a ternary at 1134. 
- move to promises at 1135. 
- bad way wrapped up at 1139
- better promises at 1140. Promises are good if you want things to run in a specific order, async and await are better if you just want to go on and come back to the data when its done being retrieved. 
- refactoring replit demo wrapped up at 1145. 
- Module demo starts at 1158
- has two "repos" in one VS code, now das nice. You can do this, just make sure you have a terminal for each repo  to run front/back end server. 
- Final exam is set up this way.  
- `*` in programming selects "everything" and is called the wildcard. 
- what makes it a module? module.exports=`<moduleName>`;
- you then have to import it as a dependency in server.js in a similar way to cors and axios, done at 1210 P. 
- making another module at 1212
- modules are made to implement "separation of concerns"
- we would have one for movies and one for weather.  
- not found js shown at 1218. 
- class wrap up at 1219

# Day 9 Reading

[Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1. What is functional programming? A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? If pure, it will return the same result given the same arguements, and does not cause any observable side effects.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function? Pure functions are much easier to test.
4. What is immutability? inability to be changed. Data which is immutable cannot have its state changed after being created.
5. What is Referential transparency? the simultaneous usage of pure functions and immitable data.

[Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)

1. What is a module? a way to separate out different bits of code based on their functionality, basically just another JavaScript file. 
2. What does the word ‘require’ do? allows us to use functionality from a module inside of another module. its part of the global object. 
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in? `require('./module')`;
4. What do we have to do to make a module available? We have to explicitly say which part of the module we want available inside of the other module. module.exports = counter; in the module, then
