# Notes Day 5

### Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)<br />
If image in code is place before a paragraph, the paragraph starts on a new line after the image. If the inside the start of the paragraph, the first row of text aligns with bottom of image, if in the middle of a paragraph it is between the text. <br />
Align attribute was used to put the image to the left or the right, allowing text to flow around the side of the image. This is now done in CSS. <br />
Three rules of creating images: 
1. Save images in the right format. This may require you to edit the image you want to use. Can either increase or decrease image size, or change chape via cropping. 
2. Save images at the right size. Don’t want to have space where the image is not continued, or zoom in too much and lose the edges of the image. 
3. Use the correct resolution. Images for the internet should be saved at a resolution of 72PPI. <br />
Vector Images: Resolution independent. Allows you to increase the dimensions of the image without affecting the quality of it. Work by placing points on a grid, then filling in color between the lines. <br />
### Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
Color can be specified using either RGB, hex codes, or color names. <br />
Background Color: CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in the box, thatbox will have the specified background color. <br />
Colors are made of three parts, Hue, saturation (amount of grey) and brightness (amount of black)<br />
Contrast: Text is easier to read if there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors. If you have a light color on a dark background (my favorite), increasing height between the lines and the weight of the font can make it easier to read. <br />
Opacity: RGBA, the A element is the opacity. <br />
HSL and HSLA: Stands for hue saturation and lightness. hue is an angle between 0 and 360 degrees, saturation is a percentage, and lightness is a %, with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black. A once again stands for transparency. <br />

### Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)

Typeface terminology: 
- Serif has extra details on main strokes
- sans serif have straight ends to letters
- Monospace: each letter in the font has the same width. 
- Weight: how bolded the text is
- Style: Normal, italic, oblique..
- stretch: "blowing up" the letters. <br />
Font types: browser will only display a font that the computer has installed. Can have a font stack, so thatif the desired font isnt installed on the computer then the computer will run other fonts further down the stack. 
- font family: this property allows you to specify the typeface that hsould be used for any text inside the elements to which a css rule applies.<br /> 
- font size allows you to specify the size of the font, which can be done in pixes (allows for precise control) percentages (relative to the default size of text to 16 px) or ems (width of a letter m).<br />
- @font-face allows you to use a font even if it is not installed on the users computer. should specify the source as well. May need to specify different sources for different browsers. 
- text transform is used to cause the case of the text to change. 
- text decoration can allow you to remove any already extant text decoration, add underline or overline, put a line through. <br />
- line-height is used to specify the spacing between lines in text. 
- letter-spacing and word-spacing allow you to, you guessed it, control the spacing between letters of the same words and words in a paragraph. 
- text allign property allows you to control the alignment of text, and be left, right, center or justify, in which every line of the paragraph will take up the full width of the box. 
- Verical align is commonly used with inline elements such as img em or strong. 
- text indent allows you to inden the first line of text within an element. 
- text shadow is used to create a shadow effect by creating a dark version of the word just behind it and slightly offset. 
- first-letter and first-line pseudo-elements which specify different values for the firstl etter or line of text inside of an element. 
- link and visited are used to have different styles of links thathave or have not yet been clicked on by the user. 
- hover: psuedo class that is applied whe nthe user hovers over an element. 
- active: applied when the element is being activated by a user. 
- applied to an element that has focus.
