# Notes Day 5

## 12/18 lecture Notes

let tells us that we have a new variable. 

New  Array (10).fill('') will create a new array with a length of 10, with each of entry of array equal to an empty string. Could be useful if you wanted to fill an array with a a bunch of default values, ie true or false. <br />
We will be seeing more of the new array feature next week. .fill is a method on the array. <br />
Methods are like functions you can only run on certain types of things. <br />
More on arrays: <br />
if you add to an index of on array and have some parts of the array you havnt assigned a value to, those spots are undefined. The following are array methods:<br />
- .fill() fills up and entire array with given value
- .push() adds an element on to the end of an array. Can be used to add multiple items to an array. 
- .pop() takes out the last element on an array.
- .shift() takes the first item off array, and reduces index for all remaining elements.  
- .unshift() adds an item to the front of the array, and reorders all elements after it. takes alot more processing power than push does. 
- .splice(start-index>), specify number of items to remove and what to add if anything. Takes at least two arguements, can take three. If you want to add items in different spots, you have to run multpile splices. BUT if you want to add multiple items in a series starting at an index of your choice, you can just use one splice.
- When we take items off an array using a method, the method also returns that value. Pop, shift are good examples of this.

Now to CSS stuff, specifically selectors

- div: Selects everything in the HTML tag labeled div
- div: selects div tag with the class of car.
- .car: selects everything with the class of car. 
- div > span: this is the direct child selector, only selects to spans that are direct children of div
- div span: applies to all spans of the div, children, grand children, great grand children etc. 
- div + span: adjacent sibling selector. it selects an element that is directly after a particular selector. So its looking for a span that is directly after a particular seelctor. 
- div ~ span: general sibling selector. it selects all elements that are siblings of a particular selector. 
---
now we start with pseudo-selectors

- li:first-child will select only the first child of the unordered list. to select anything else you do le:nth-child(pass the number of the child you want here){code here}. 
- first of type or nth of type lets you target the numbered you specify type of.
- hover: institutes a change when you put your cursor over the element. 
- psuedo-elements are written with ::. like ul::after

W3 schools is excellent for HTML and CSS, not as great for JS though. <br />
Note that we were able to target alot of stuff on this page without having to go in and adding classes or ids. So selectors are oftentimes the only way you can get them if you for some reason cannot alter the HTML.

Layout Principals with CSS 

You want to start the top of your CSS file with *<br /> {
  box-sizing:border-box;<br />
}<br />
This makes the box model more manageable. 
- All html tags are by default either block level or inline element. Block pushes other elements to other lines, and take up the full width of the browser window. to center it, you need to set margin to auto and reduce the width. 
- inline elements dont try to take up the whole width, it wants to wrap around and fit into things. So to center it you have to override it being a line, by setting the display to block element. 
- margin auto applies to all side of the box, and margin top for instance just does one side. So you need to do the auto first and then the margin top after. 
- there are some default values, for example the border color if unspecified is black. 
- Floating: can have issues, with boxes floating outside of their background color for example. Sheyna says you can user overflow:auto to hack it and make it look a little better, but this can sometimes give you a scroll bar to the right which is not at all what you want. 
- if we display inline, it can affect our margins. If we display as an inline block, our margins padding etc stay intact. 
--- 
CSS Positioning: 
- there is a property in CSS called position. It declares how the element will position itself to the other elements around it. 
- it can be static or relative. On its own, relative doesnt do anything. But by using properties like left top bottom or right you can move the element around on your page. Relative means relative to the orignal position. 
- Static makes top bottom left right have no effect. 
- This element displays relative to its most recent parent element with positioning set. If it has no positioned parent, it will display relative to the page window. would use because you have far greater control in placing elements in relation to other items on your page. It takes an element out of the page flow, so you have alot of precision in where you can place items. 
- position fixed: Will position the element relative to the viewport window. it will stay in the same place even if the page scrolls. It will cover elements and obscure them. 
---
JavaScript stuff now <br />
want a function taht takes in an array, adds the first 3 items, reutrnas a different array with two elements (indices). the 2 elements will be: 
1. a message 
2. the sum of the three items. 

Branches: 
- we will be using branches for all assignments going forward. 
- there are two timelines in git, what is on your compuer and what is on github. Things only exist on github if you push them to github, and changes only exist on computer if you pulled them from github. 
- We use git clone url to get from github to the computer. 
- TO CREATE A BRANCH, from my machine I create a new branch by using git checkout -b <branch-name **/>. This also moves you to this branch when you use the command. 
- if we wanted to ACP the branch to github, the push part is be git push origin </*insert branch-name here ><br />
- Then, on github, create a pull request from your new branch to your Main branch. <br /> 
- to get back to main branch you enter git checkout main. 
- that code will not display, so you need to pull from github. She has a drawing of this. 
- branch is basically a copy of your work that you are being experimental with, which, if it works out you send back to main branch and send to gitHub. 
- Moving forward, for each assignment you will be creating a branch for that assignment. This is how big teams work on the same code base without really screwing up the whole thing. 

Assignments: CSS diner is due at midnight. 
Lab assignment for today is fun with functions, follow instructions CAREFULLY, you will be making alot of git branches. 
Make sure what is being tested is EXACTLY the same. 

## Reading notes

### Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)<br />
If image in code is place before a paragraph, the paragraph starts on a new line after the image. If the inside the start of the paragraph, the first row of text aligns with bottom of image, if in the middle of a paragraph it is between the text. <br />
Align attribute was used to put the image to the left or the right, allowing text to flow around the side of the image. This is now done in CSS. <br />
Three rules of creating images: 
1. Save images in the right format. This may require you to edit the image you want to use. Can either increase or decrease image size, or change chape via cropping. 
2. Save images at the right size. Don’t want to have space where the image is not continued, or zoom in too much and lose the edges of the image. 
3. Use the correct resolution. Images for the internet should be saved at a resolution of 72PPI. <br />
Vector Images: Resolution independent. Allows you to increase the dimensions of the image without affecting the quality of it. Work by placing points on a grid, then filling in color between the lines. <br />
### Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
Color can be specified using either RGB, hex codes, or color names. <br />
Background Color: CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in the box, thatbox will have the specified background color. <br />
Colors are made of three parts, Hue, saturation (amount of grey) and brightness (amount of black)<br />
Contrast: Text is easier to read if there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors. If you have a light color on a dark background (my favorite), increasing height between the lines and the weight of the font can make it easier to read. <br />
Opacity: RGBA, the A element is the opacity. <br />
HSL and HSLA: Stands for hue saturation and lightness. hue is an angle between 0 and 360 degrees, saturation is a percentage, and lightness is a %, with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black. A once again stands for transparency. <br />

### Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)

Typeface terminology: 
- Serif has extra details on main strokes
- sans serif have straight ends to letters
- Monospace: each letter in the font has the same width. 
- Weight: how bolded the text is
- Style: Normal, italic, oblique..
- stretch: "blowing up" the letters. <br />
Font types: browser will only display a font that the computer has installed. Can have a font stack, so thatif the desired font isnt installed on the computer then the computer will run other fonts further down the stack. 
- font family: this property allows you to specify the typeface that hsould be used for any text inside the elements to which a css rule applies.<br /> 
- font size allows you to specify the size of the font, which can be done in pixes (allows for precise control) percentages (relative to the default size of text to 16 px) or ems (width of a letter m).<br />
- @font-face allows you to use a font even if it is not installed on the users computer. should specify the source as well. May need to specify different sources for different browsers. 
- text transform is used to cause the case of the text to change. 
- text decoration can allow you to remove any already extant text decoration, add underline or overline, put a line through. <br />
- line-height is used to specify the spacing between lines in text. 
- letter-spacing and word-spacing allow you to, you guessed it, control the spacing between letters of the same words and words in a paragraph. 
- text allign property allows you to control the alignment of text, and be left, right, center or justify, in which every line of the paragraph will take up the full width of the box. 
- Verical align is commonly used with inline elements such as img em or strong. 
- text indent allows you to inden the first line of text within an element. 
- text shadow is used to create a shadow effect by creating a dark version of the word just behind it and slightly offset. 
- first-letter and first-line pseudo-elements which specify different values for the firstl etter or line of text inside of an element. 
- link and visited are used to have different styles of links thathave or have not yet been clicked on by the user. 
- hover: psuedo class that is applied whe nthe user hovers over an element. 
- active: applied when the element is being activated by a user. 
- applied to an element that has focus. 
- any element that you can interact iwth can have focus.
