### [React Docs - lists and keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)<br>

1. Whatdoes .map() return? <br>
map applies a function to an array and then creates a new array which has the results of the function. <br>
2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in  JSX, how do I do that in React?<br>
You use map to generate an array, save them as a const such as listItems, then put the const into either an ordered or unordered list item.
3. Each list item needs a unique key. It is recommended to use IDs from your data if possible, and use index ONLY if the order of your array wont change. 
4. What is the purpose of a key? Keys help react keep track of which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
 
### [How to Use the Spread Operator (…) in JavaScript](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

1. What is the spread operator? (...), it expoands an interable object into the list of arguements. 
2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do. <br>
  a. adding to state in react. <br>
  b. using math functions. <br>
  c. Combining arays<br>
  d. using an array as an arguement.<br>
3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]<br>
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]<br>
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]<br>
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩<br>
4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']<br>
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]<br>
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]<br>
5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}<br>
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}<br>
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}<br>
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }<br>

### [How to Pass Functions Between Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU)<br>

1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?<br> He creates a function in the same area as the state he wants to change. 
2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?<br> Increment is passed the person object, loops through them using the map method, to pass updated state values to the ppl array, and adds to one for each time the add button is clicked for a given person.    
3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?<br>
you have to go inside of the child component, and then use this."what you are referencing". in the example he showed, we would know have this.props.increment. <br>
4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?<br> You call it by going inside of function you want to call, then use this.props."reference"
