# Day 3 Reading

### [React Docs - lists and keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)<br>

1. Whatdoes .map() return? <br>
map applies a function to an array and then creates a new array which has the results of the function. <br>
2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in  JSX, how do I do that in React?<br>
You use map to generate an array, save them as a const such as listItems, then put the const into either an ordered or unordered list item.
3. Each list item needs a unique key. It is recommended to use IDs from your data if possible, and use index ONLY if the order of your array wont change. 
4. What is the purpose of a key? Keys help react keep track of which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 
 
### [How to Use the Spread Operator (…) in JavaScript](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

1. What is the spread operator? (...), it expoands an interable object into the list of arguements. 
2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do. <br>
  a. adding to state in react. <br>
  b. using math functions. <br>
  c. Combining arays<br>
  d. using an array as an arguement.<br>
3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]<br>
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]<br>
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]<br>
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩<br>
4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']<br>
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]<br>
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]<br>
5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}<br>
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}<br>
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}<br>
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }<br>

### [How to Pass Functions Between Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU)<br>

1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?<br> He creates a function in the same area as the state he wants to change. 
2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?<br> Increment is passed the person object, loops through them using the map method, to pass updated state values to the ppl array, and adds to one for each time the add button is clicked for a given person.    
3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?<br>
you have to go inside of the child component, and then use this."what you are referencing". in the example he showed, we would know have this.props.increment. <br>
4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?<br> You call it by going inside of function you want to call, then use this.props."reference"


# Day 3 Lecture Notes 4/30

For today, in the ReadMe there is some update since last class. <br>

In class 7 we will be going into axios. We will be expected to read the docs ourselves to get an idea of how it works. <br>

Lifting state is a key component of what we are doing today. <br>

at 925 Hexx reviews key words and vocabulary from the second class. Very helpful. <br>

Today we are going to go over modals, which are basically just popups. <br>

By class 7, we will deploy to heroku. <br> 

this.setState() is responsible for changing/updating the state.   <br>

Be sure to review the readME in day three to get the definitions. <br> 
at 940 we switch to lab code review <br> 
at 948 goes over how to use map to get all of the titles URLS and descriptions for the beasts. <br> 
at 954 starts going over how to add the counter. <br> 

npm install bootstrap react-bootsrap is the command to put react onto your  file <br>
To import it, go to react bootstrap website, then get the code from CSS part, then import into your index.js. import it after your index.css import. <br>
Container adds some natural padding around what you put into in once you are looking at the site itself. Can then import rows and columns from bootstamp. <br>
Hexx specificaly recommends grid cards. <br> 
Zoom crash around 1006 <br> 
Up and running at 1014, came back to class on break. <br> 

Resumed at 1023 <br>  

Can use rows/columns to make a grid of cards you can put in. The documentation has information on how you want to display, ie beats/row. On a small/med/large screen you can choose how many beasts to render per row. <br> 

To add some space between the content of the card and the edges of the card, you can put the card contents into a container, which in turn is inside of the card. Dont forget to import the container above. <br> 

Do the stretch goal today during class. <br>  

Did some code challenge, wrapped at 1045ish, now onto todays topics. <br> 

How does a child component update the state of a parent component? <br> We lift the state. <br> 

Be sure to review the README for todays class. Today we are focusing on passing fucntions to lift state. <br> 
Modals come from react bootstrap. With modal on, you cant interact with the page until the modal is turned off. <br> 

npx create-react-app 'app name' is how you create the application. <br>  
Dont forget to install bootstrap for this, react bootstrap and bootstrap. <br>  
Can use card group to organize the cards, goes over this at 1113. <br> 
Adds button at 1114<br> 

Goes overdraft modal around 1124<br> 

Goes to our lab today at 1137. <br> 
There is also a partner power hour at 1215, Sam Ham is coming to talk about helpful tips. He invented salmon cookies. <br>  
Review the demo from earlier to render each beast in the main. <br>  
Selected beast IS your modal. <br> 
Stretch goal use redjects?? <br>
