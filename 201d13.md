### Local Storage

URL for reading: http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html<br/>

For persistent local storage, native client applications have had an advantage over web applications. <br/>
Cookies can help, but they can slow the web application, send unencrypted data, and are limited to 4KB of data. <br/>

HTML5 helps with this. <br/>

History: 
- Several different companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Adobe sought to provide better local storage in what are known as the Great Browser Wars... <br/>
- All the early solutions were either specific to a single browser or reliant on a thrid party plugin. 
- HTML5 setout to provide a standardized API, which would work across multiple plugins and not need to rely on third party plugins. 

HTML5 Storage is a specification named Web Storage, and some vendors refer to it as Local Storage or DOM storage. <br/>
#### Web Storage is a way for web pages to store key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. 
- similar to cookies, the data persists after the user leaves the site, closes their browser tab, etc. 
- However, the data is never transmitted to the remote web server, and it is available eeven when third part plugins are not. <br/>

`function supports_html5_storage() {`<br/>
  `try {`<br/>
    `return 'localStorage' in window && window`<br/>`['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {`<br/>
    `return false;`<br/>
 ` }`<br/>
`}` <br/>

The above code lets you check if HTML5 is supported on your browser. 

HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. 
- data is stored based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. 
- the named key is a string
- The data can be any type supported by JS, however that data WILL be stored as a string.

There are a list of commands and what they do, reference this when you are implementing Local Storage yourself. <br/>

You can also track changes to the HTML5 Storage Area. The aurthor calls this trapping the storage event. <br/>
Storage even is fired on the window object whenever setItem() removeItem() or Clear() is called and  ***actually changes something***  <br/>


### 1/22/2022 Lecture Notes 

Do not forget to read the What Google Learned from its quest to build the perfect team. <br/>

60 second pitch assignment is due in two weeks, begin going over that now. <br/> 

Resume review by your accountability partners, that will be due BEFORE the review by your instructor. <br/>
So update your resume, have partners review it, then the instructor. In 201, they are mostly looking to see that it is completely filled out. <br/>
Final exam Unlocks Tonight, you have to get 19/25 questions right to pass. <br/>

Persistance of Data: The ability to store data so it can be accessed later, we will be doing that with local Storage. <br/>
Local storage is done in your browser on your computer. <br/>
Going back to her Goat page, she went thru and got the chart to pop up, but then she left and returned to the page and the chart was gone. <br/>
- So if the data persists, the chart would still be there and data from the previous goat voting would still be there. <br/> 
- Note that the data persists only on the users computer and others do not have access. 
- We make databases in 301!!!. <br/>
- In HTML, the select tag in a form is what you use to get a drop down menu with pre selected options. <br/>
- inside of the select, you use the option tag to make your drop down items. <br/>
- There is a way to prevent the default values for the drop down menus from being the inital guess, shell get back to us after break.<br/>
- She is going over the Bus Mall Timeline. 
- If you save products and then reload the page, you will duplicate your products. How do you make sure you dont duplicate your products? 
- at start of timeline, check to see if local storage exists and has products inside, and if it does, don't render any more products (or use them, or delete them. Its up to you really). If it doesnt, then you create instances of products. 
- look for labeled products in local storage
- if you want to use the already extant items in local storage, take them out, unpack them, and put them in products array? 
- She has a drawn out listof this, look for it. 
- JSON stands for JavaScriptObjectNotation, used to turn objects and arrays into strings. 
- Need to take the stored instance of drink or product which is a POJO and reInstantiate it as a drink or product object. 
- reinstantiation is done by running the POJO back through the constructor function.
- JSON.parse turns the string from the objects and turns them into the POJO's.
- lab 14 will require you to reInstantiate an object, but its better to get he practice with reinstantiating it now.  

### 1/24/2022 Lecture Notes 

Final Exam is now open. She strongly suggests that you prioritze a good chunk of time to focus on the exam. <br/>

Make sure that you check each question and answer section to ensure that it isn't scrollable content. <br/>
There are instructions to submit a link, and it's basically a freebee from what she is saying. <br/>

What is an algorithm?: a step by step process that tells us what we need to do. <br/>

Code Challenege, she went over arrow functions again, and mentioned terniaries. <br/>
A terniary is a more compact way to write an if Else statement. a ? b = 3: b=5<br/>

empty strings acting kind of like booleans. She is making variables in repl<br/> 


Code review for local Storage. Dannys CSS looks pretty solid, Need to fix your CSS tbh. Can Check Dannys JS and see how you can make it work on your end. <br/> 
The JSON.parse() method parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string. An optional reviver function can be provided to perform a transformation on the resulting object before it is returned.<br/>  
Once something has been parsed, it is only a plain old JavaScript Object, so we cannot render it. So it has to be sent back through the constructor function in order to be properly rendered again. <br/> 
To get POJO's to have access to methods again, you can iterate through them, you can take the objects of no type and then run it through the constructor with the values of that object orignal.<br/>  

Danny added them through in the Chart after he stored and accessed the local storage before rendering the chart. Go over his method. <br/> 
Sessions = cookies, not local storage. 

Sunday is the last day to submit past work again. <br/>
