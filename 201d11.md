1/11/2021 Lecture Notes: Debugging You code<br/>

Starting with a code challenge. <br/>
This one was a doozy, go back to the lecture video to review. <br/>
Now onto debugging. <br/>
- Ideal is to never have any bugs. 
How do we prevent bugs? 
1. write code in small chunks, do proof of life and regular testing. This keeps your problems from accumulating. 
2. write asserions to check and see if things are true or not in your code. `if (username){console.log(username)};`
3. user a linter, it is your coding spell check.
4. console.log stuff. 
5. using breakpoints to analyze your code. 
6. meaningful comments in your code. 

Okay, so what do we do when we do have bugs happen? 
1. Find where the bug is happening. 
2. inspect the code. 
3. identify the problem.
4. 2nd set of eyes 
5. run the code peice by peice; ie comment out all your code and add it back in peice by peice. 
6. Take a break. 

How do we find where the problem is? 
1. Code old console check. 
2. READ THE ERROR MESSAGE!!! (refer to the line the error occurred on.)
3. refer to syntax. 

Things you should console.log when you expect there is a problem. 
1. type; is the variable the type you are expecting? 
2. value; is the variable the value that you are expecting at each step? 
3. read the DOCS!. So go and look at the documentation that already exists on it and apply it to your situation. 
4. think about the order your code runs in. Tell yourself the story of your code, line by line, write down the variable values at each step.

Reading Assignments lock after 24hrs, learning journals lock after 48hrs. <br/>
Final Exam opens on 22nd, and is due on the 30th. She recommends doing it the week of the 23rd. <br/>
Last day to resubmit homework from old assignments is the 30th, the day before the beggining of project week. <br/>
For the final project, there will be no "backend". So that is a limitation. Internet data is available through API's, but we don't get into those until 301. <br/>
We can use local storage though, which we will have learned about by the time class starts. <br/>

She is going over salmon cookies now, starting at 640pm. <br/>
Start with creating a constructor. Inside of HTML, there is a table with thead tbody and tfoot already made. <br/>
Do a review of prototype in JS, I'm still not very clear on what it is or when to use it. <br/>
stopped for break at 730<br/>
on nested for loops at 755. <br/>
can add the required attribute on your input so that the code will not run unless all fields are properly entered in. <br/>
You need an event listener so that the JS knows the user clicked on the button. <br/>
All great info tbh, still good at the 834PM mark. Worth rewatching while you work on Salmon Cookies. <br/>
To fix the footer row with the totals, you need to delete the bottom row, then add the footer function into it again. deletes the bottom row via tfoot.InnerHTML("") to set it equal to an empty string. <br/>
She then adds a clear option to the form via form.reset(). 

### Image Types: 
- jpeg; the most versatile image file type, recommended in use for most of your photos. Not a very large filetype, so it can simplify your images slightly. 
- png; useful for higher quality images. take more memory than a jpg, but you get a better quality image. Always a balancing act between the greatest quality content but not taking up too much of the users time. More than 5 seconds for the page to load and the user is outta there. So, only use PNG if there is a definite need for it, such as with graphics (things with text) or images that require invisibility. 
- gif; good for short animations. Can be used for photos and does have invisibility built in, but it is a very low quality image type. 
- svg; vector based, so they are very good for graphics, logos, things without photos. Vector art is done with a math Program, and there is an actual formula in the filetype telling the computer where to draw the lines. 

### Font Awesome
There are vector based fonts on fontawesome.com. We are going to use these to add more fonts to the kitten project. In order to use fontAwesome you have to create an account there. <br/>
You can use fontAwesome without paying, dont listen to what the website says. <br/>
When you link FontAwesome, be sure to link it before you link your regular CSS. Then find and select the ICON you want, then copy the HTML and put it into your index, she put the icon inside of the footer in this instance, but that isnt alawys the way to do it. Because it is vector art, you can immediately edit and style it using CSS. <br/>

Tonights Assignment: Chocolate Pizza. Pair Programming, you will be assigned a partner. 2 hours per person in each role. <br/>
Hint: Dashed line is one tiny image that is repeating over and over again. Will need to use fontAwesome to get the icons from there. There is also an asset folder in lab10a on gitHub. <br/>
This project will have HTML, CSS, not necessarily any JS. <br/>
In pair programming, you should be discussing the project together, if you have a disagreement, hands off computer, figure out a way forward, then move forward. You may ask questions to people not in your group. <br/>
Create 1 repo, then give your partner permission in gitHub to push to it. Add partner in gitHub, do your work on a branch, push it up, then have them branch off it and start their work. <br/>
Chocolate Pizza is a prereq to taking 301, so if you tried to test into 301, you would have to do chocolate pizza. If you take a break between 201 and 301, you will be required to do chocolate pizza again. 


Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)

Images are inline elements by default <br/>
Images can be positioned via CSS similar to other inline elements. <br/>
For background images, you can lower the contrast of the image to make any text laid over it easier to read. <br/>


Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)<br/>
Search Enginge optimization is the tweaking of your website so that it is more visible on to search engines. On page techniques are methods you can use on the page itself, and off page techniques look athow often your site is linked and what other sites have content related to your own. <br/>
On page SEO requires: 
1. page title
2. url/web address
3. headings. 
4. text
5. link text 
6. image alt text.
7. page descriptions 

Analytics: You can analyze how people came to find your website and at what point they are leaving, you can use google analytics for this. It also shows you how many people come to ytour site, page views, average time spent on site, what they are looking at, and what websites they are coming from.  <br/>

Chapter 9: pages 201-206 only. 

Ahh.... who doesn't look back fondly at flash games? <br/>

Flash was used to add animations video and audio to your website. It goes over the brief history of flash, with animation functionality being in place in 1996, audio in 1999, and video in 2002. <br/>
