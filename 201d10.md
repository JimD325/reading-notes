# Reading and Lecture Notes; Day 10

We are now at the halfway point of the class. The final exam will be issued on the 22nd. It is the barrier between you and project week. It is required you pass the final exam to do it. <br/>
She recommends doing it some day of the week of the 22nd. <br/>
Quizes are a good way to study for the final exam. <br/>
Unlike the weekly quizzes, there are not unlimited retakes for the final exam. You have two total attempts to take it. <br/>
Final exam is not meant to be a gotcha, just study in advance of the exam. <br/>

There are three lab assignments due this week as a part of class ten. <br/>
Lab 10a is a partner programming assignment, and you will have exactly 4 hours to do it. Use your time wisely. <br/>
Lab 10b is to finish the Salmon Cookies project. She expects you to have it all done before class by thursday. <br/>
Lab 10c is Git exercises. <br/> 
Tonight, she recommends: Finishing Salmon cookies first; possibly even finishing it tonight; then skimming the reading for tomorrow. Don't worry too much for it, her exact words were to skim it. <br/>
Now on to code challenge. Link: https://replit.com/@rkgallaway/class-09-review-event-handling-and-form <br/>

  let paragraph = document.createElement('p');
  paragraph.textContent = `this is my sentence with ${username}, ${userAge}, and ${userCity}`;
  myContainer.appendChild(paragraph);

This is the method we have been using to create an element, put text inside of the element, then add the element to the DOM tree. 

So.. this code comes up all the time. So if we use this bit of code all the time, why not turn it into a function and simplify using it? 

so...  <br/>

function createNewElement(newEl, textContent, parentEl){
  let newElement = document.createElement(newEl);
  paragraph.textContent = textContent;
  parentElement.appendChild(paragraph);
};


Did a code review. Now back onto the Kitten Project. Can refactor code in Salmon cookies by creating a function that creates the element, puts in the text content, and appends it to the DOM. <br/>

For final salmon cookies, create a function to clean up the code in which you are appending text document. Do this TONIGHT. 

If you need to remove and replace something in innerHTML, can use innerHTML, she says its applicable to Salmon Cookies. 

## Reading: Debugging JS

Debugging is about deduction. 
1.	Where is the problem? Look at the error message and investigate what it says. 
2.	Check how far the script is running, use tools to write message to the console to tell how far your script has executed. 
3.	Use breakpoints where things are going wrong. 
4.	What exactly is the problem? When you have set breakpoints, you can see if the variables around them have the values you would expect them to. 
5.	Break down/break out parts of the code to test smaller pieces of the functionality. 
6.	Check the number of parameters for a function, or the number of items in an array. 

You can pause the execution of a script on any line using breakpoints. You go to the sources option, select the script you are working on, and when you run the script it will stop on that line. You can then hover over any variable to see its value at that time in the scripts execution. <br/>
If you know code might fail, you can use try catch and finally. <br/>
Try: you specify the code that you think might throw an exception within the try block. 
Catch: if the try code block throws an exceptioim catch steps in with an alternative set of code. <br/>
Finally: the contents of the finally code block will run either way, regardless of whether or not the try block succeeded or failed. <br/>
General Tips: 
1.	Some problems are browser specific, so try another browser. 
2.	Write numbers to the console so you can see which of the items get logged. 
3.	Remove parts of code and strip it down to the minimum you need. 
4.	Explaining the code to someone else can help you find a solution to your problem.
5.	Search for the answer online. 
6.	You can add your code to a code playground, where others can try and do it. 
7.	Validation tools.
