# 6/6 lecture notes

- AUTH is NOT on your final exam. Everything except for updating and AUTH is fair game for it though. 
- Thursday reading MUST BE DONE prior to being in class for DIE discussion. 
- React, Bootstrap, and CRUD are needed for final exam, database is already set up though. 
- Edge Cases: All of the weird potential things that could happen and cause your code to break. 
- Exam is mostly on Create Read and Delete, as well as properly implementing a bootstrap component. 
- Create: 
  - this is lab 12, and is on the final. 
  - start with the backend, verify its working, then move to the front end.
  - can name your database in mongo
  - inside of your routes, app.post('/books', createBooks). You then need to defeine create books inside of your handlers. She had a separate handlers.js file, from which she puts all the code for read, create, update, and delete needed on the backend. the response we want is repsonse.body. 
  - in thunderclient, you POST to the body, and the json content you put in should perfectly match the schema, with the key value pairs surrounded by "". double quotes are required. 
  - DO NOT FORGET TO ADD in the middleware app.use(express.json());
  - Now to front end. 

- Update:
  - app.put('/books/:id', Handle.updateBook)= backend.
  - copy and paste what you put in for delete, then update to have all relevant stuff for update. 
  - change to await Book.findByIdAndUpdate(request.params.id, request.body {new:true})
  - not a specific status for a successful update, so response.status(200).send(updatedBook) is fine. 
  - overwrite:true is not what you really want for this, so go back and remove it on what you and Luis did. 


- Delete: 
  - continuation of lab 12. 
  - add app.delete('/books/:id', Handler.deleteBook) note that the :id is the param you are passing. 

## 6/7 Lecture Authorization and Authentication

- Auth Zero is what we are learning, dont get it twisted. 
- This is plug and play, don't worry about the behind the scenes work, just know what the peice of it does. 
- Auth will not be on the exam, although it will be on the final project. 
- All Auth0 stuff is written in functional compoenents, so keep in mind the difference between with auth0 and use Auth0
- Steps to implement are in the class 15 repo. 
- Authorization is do you have permission to do this? Authentications are who are you?
- OAuth example: logging into something using your google account. 
- OAuth vs Auth0: OAuth lets your account info to be used by 3rd parties without exposing your credentials to the 3rd party. 
- Auth0 is headquartered in Bellevue. Uses OAuth under the hood
- When you start out, 
- index.js with auto0: put domain, clientid, and redirectURI into the Auth0Provider Component tag. 
- The domain is secret, and goes into the env file. REACT_APP_DOMAIN = <`value for domain`> in env, then domain=process.env.REACT_APP_DOMAIN in the index. Do the same with the clientID. 
- will need to create an email property on the back end so that you can identify the user. 
- in backend, env needs to include jwks_URL as well as mongo. 
- dont forget app.use(express.json())
- do all the datawrangling on the backend, that is the job of the API provider.
