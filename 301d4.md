# Class 4 Reading Notes: React and Forms


React Docs - Forms
1.	What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
When a react component that is responsible for rendering, also controls what happens in that component for subsequent user input. 
2.	Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
We should wait to store user responses until they submit, because otherwise the users computer will re-render every time they press a key. 

3.	How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
We use event.target.value

1.	Why would we use a ternary operator?
To reduce a conditional if else statement to a single line. 
2.	Rewrite the statement using a ternary statement:<br>
General Form: condition ? value if true : value if false<br>
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
	



# 5/2 Lecture 
Today is start of day 4. Going over sort <br>

State is an object. <br>
++ only increments in a iteration of a loop, so can't use that for a counter <br> 

Did a easter egg hunt for errors in JS react at the start. <br>

704 pm we start a review of class 3 terms. <br> 

710 we do lab review. <br> 

# 5/3 Lecture

Lot to go over today demo-wise, might be a bit rushed. <br>

Did a breakout team code challenge ish thing. Prevent default keeps page from reloading before you can get the data. document.getELementbyId('myForm').addEventListener('submit', event => {event.preventDefault(); console.log("submitted!");})<br>

In HTML, if you are changing HTML based on user input, in changes as they type. If it is based on a submit on a form, it will change only when they submit. <br>

Event Listner vs event Handler: <br>
Event listener just listens for the event. includes onSubmit, onClick, input, onChange.<br>
Event handler is the function thatdoes somethign with the value the comes from the event. 

If I am listening for an onChange on the input field, how do I access the value that the user is typing in? <br>
Event.target.value. 

If the form is my child component, how do I send the information collected from that form up to the parent component? <br>
We lift the state. we define a parent thatg ets passed down to the child. The child calls that function and passes it the value(s) from the form to be saved in state in the Parent. <br>

Hexx ACP this to the class gitHub. Then starts a new react app for forms in React.  <br>

Do not declare global variables in React, but dont do it for now, thats what state is for. So dont declare global horns, use their properties and pass them up into state. <br>

Put form in a container, then use Form.Control to list all the numbers of horns. <br>
