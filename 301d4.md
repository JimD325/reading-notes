# Class 4 Reading Notes: React and Forms


React Docs - Forms
1.	What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
When a react component that is responsible for rendering, also controls what happens in that component for subsequent user input. 
2.	Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
We should wait to store user responses until they submit, because otherwise the users computer will re-render every time they press a key. 

3.	How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
We use event.target.value

1.	Why would we use a ternary operator?
To reduce a conditional if else statement to a single line. 
2.	Rewrite the statement using a ternary statement:<br>
General Form: condition ? value if true : value if false<br>
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);

Today is start of day 4. Going over sort <br>

State is an object. <br>
++ only increments in a iteration of a loop, so can't use that for a counter <br> 

Did a easter egg hunt for errors in JS react at the start. <br>
