Wireframes are basically drawn out rough drafts of websites you want to create. Typically each section will have the type of content declared at this stage, so you should know where merch, about us, etc are located on the page and in which elements. <br />

She makes a list of HTML elements you will need for it, its pretty helpful. <br />

She uses flexbox to help center some of her images. What elements are we using with flex? The container, and the items in the container. <br />
She then references the flexbox image which identifies the basics of it. <br />

To make something scroll, it takes two steps. 
1. we have to cut off the natural behavior HTML has of changing height to fit the content. So determine which container you need to control the size of to scroll, she did article section{ 
  height =320px;
}
2. now the content is overflowing. So we use overflow:auto which lets you scoll through the content if it overflows the maximum space given to it by HTML. adding overflow:auto is a good thing if you have to give a set height for a particular container, this will allow people with different default text sizes to access your content. <br />
