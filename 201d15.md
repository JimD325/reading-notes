Git Branch Process: make working branch off the Production/main branch. That is the branch you will be pushing to. Then, when you are working on it individually, you branch off of the Dev Branch for your daily activities and then merge in back in when you are done. <br/>
For your third level branch, git already knows your name and the date, so you don't need to include it. Should be named after the feature or form you are handling. Then you push it to the staging branch. <br/>
You will have your github set so that it will require two team members (not counting yourself) to review the PR before it gets merged into the staging/working branch. <br/>
Once you have reached MVP status, you as a group will create a PR and push to the primary main branch. <br/> 
Make Sure you go through the branching properly, you dont want to spend hours fixing stuff. <br/>
For our group project: Either one member of team can host the code on their gitHub. You Can also create a new organization. <br/>
In branch protection rules, you add the rule that multiple people have to okay something before it is merged under the option of require a pull request before merging.<br/>
