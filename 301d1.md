# Day One 

## Readings: Introduction to React and Components


The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability. Advantages compared to object-oriented approaches include
-	Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components
-	Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components. 

1.	What is a “component”?
A modular, portable, replaceable, and reuseable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulated its implementation and exporting it as a higher level interface.
2.	What are the characteristics of a component?
-	Reusability: they are designed to be reused in different situations in different applications.
-	Replaceable: components may be freely substituted with other similar components. 
-	Not context specific: they are designed to operate in different environments and contexts. 
-	Extensible: Can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
-	Encapsulated: A component depicts the interfaces, they allow the caller to use its functionality and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state. 
-	Independent: Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.  
3.	What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
-	Ease of deployment: As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.
-	Reduced cost: The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.
-	Ease of development: Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.
-	Reusable: The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.
-	Modification of technical complexity: A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.
-	Reliability: The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
-	System maintenance and evolution: Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
-	Independent: Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.


1.	What is “props” short for?
Properties. 
2.	How are props used in React?
They are used for passing data from one component to another. 
3.	What is the flow of props?
From parent to child.

# April 23 Lecture Notes

Instructor: Hexx King </br>
John Cokos coming in for intro </br>

John: </br> 
Everything from here on out, you're going to get mad because the parts work easier now. </br>
definition of software developer: </br>
CF guides people from all backgrounds to change their lives through fast-paced, career-focused education. We shape passionate learners with immersive training to meet industry needs and improve diversity. </br>
John was a coworker with Sheyna Watkins</br>
John loves CSS. </br>
Sheyna named her dog after Lillith, the mother of all demons </br>
Don't cheat, don't be rude or harass people </br>
Tech is all pair programming, dont work as an Island. </br>
Be sure to emphasize self care, get outside, touch grass, GET SLEEP!</br>
Be sure to utilize the tutoring, TAs, and other resources. </br>
Reach out to the people who come through for partner power hour. </br>
Theme for 201: Psychological Safety</br>
Theme for 301: Emotional Intelligence. Raise your value as a coder and a human. </br> 
Turn in your work on time, even if its incomplete. </br>
John Really likes the 5 love languages. </br>
iPhone vs Android </br>
Bias overview and mitigation strategies </br>
Question your biases, self reflect on your own opinions and snap judgements. </br> 
Explicit vs Conscious Bias: over/negative attitude and beliefs we have about other people or groups.</br>
Implicit Biases: Not always conscious but the stories you have about someone before we know who they realy are. </br>
Goes through  a list of biases, Beauty, affinity, similarity, Halo effect, horns effect, contrast effect, His favorite quote is that comparison is the theif of joy, conformity, confirmation bias, attrtibution bias. </br>
Conformity/group bias/ groupthink: In/out group dynamics: unfairly favor those in your group. </br>
Confirmation bias: tendency to favor information that confirms thier existing beliefs or hypotheses. </br>
Attribution Bias: Different rationale for your behavior vs that of others. </br>
Microagressions: intentional or unintentional cues that target persons unknowingly. Can result in exclusion.</br>
It takes everyone working together to make it work. </br>
Goal is to take a 10 minute break every hour on the hour. </br> 

Introductions at 1016: </br>
Joey Hernandez: wife has a salon, he/him, father of four, veteran of navy(combat), worked at starbucks before that, was a professional brewer, got laid off and started coding. Hexx was his first TA in 102. opened up alot of challenging things. He likes the challenge of tech, making him leave his comfort zone. He is not the main TA, but the lab TA. come to him with any kind of issues. dont forget the 15 minute rule. to javascript 401, be sure to talk to him about it.  </br>

Today you will do the lab, but after lunch you will get going on the code challenge. </br>

You are going to need to get comfortable reading the docs to know what you are doing. </br>
Be sure to reach out to either Hexx or Joshua Haddock for help </br>
Keian Anthony is a swing TA, we will only see him on saturdays most likely </br>
Be sure to work on your dev talk while you are in this class, because you will have to talk about this process in depth as you move forward. </br>
Your code will be reviewed a bunch troughout your career, so be able to speak to whatis going on in it and then be able to take the criticism from your peers. </br>
in 301, we work on floor 3 in remo </br>
If you are stuck for more than 15 minutes, call for TA. If TA and you get stuck for more than 15 minutes, call for Hexx. </br>
this coming thursday the 28th, there is 301n25 Final Presentations. you WILL be in these presentations. afterwards you will break back into REMO</br>
Be in REMO for the entirety of the time alloted, otherwise she will track you. </br>
Stacked Modules: very difficult way of learning, but once you get to the end it all makes sense as long as you put in the work. </br> 
Hexx recommends not memorizing anything, just know how to figure it out. </br> 
Submit assignments on time, but DO NOT JUST NOT SUBMIT THEM, even if its incomplete. </br>


## Classes </br>
Started at 1150AM. </br>
To make a class, you need a constructor, and into that class constructor you pass the properties or props. </br>
Extends is used to make dog a subclass of animal. If you are going to make new dogs, you need to instantiate new dog with things like breed. </br>
You must then use super(props) in the dog constructor to allow dog to use the props. </br>
this.breed = breed. </br>
Method is like a verb- it DOES Something. It is a function on a class. </br>
speak =() => {</br>
  console.log('put stuff here')</br>
}</br>
new is a keyword which gives us a new instance of whatever class follows it. </br>
you call a function by doing instatiation.function. </br>
so spot.speak() has the instatiation of dog called spot execute the speak function. </br>
end at 1202 pm, come back to zoom after lunch at 102pm.  

Back from lunch at 102PM. 

Be sure to go through the class Repo. 

## React 

The library we used back in 201 was chart.js. </br>

React was developed by Facebook. </br>

Create Read Update and Delete = CRUD, will talk about in module 2. </br> 
React lets you create mini components that you can use over and over again. React is prewritten code that allows us to organize our code into components to be used over and over again.</br> 
React documentation is provided, but not the best to read for a noob. </br> 
npx = node package executer</br>
We are in the process of updating the curriculum after React just had a massive update.</br> 

starting with app.js </br>
go to index.js and remove import and the code at the bottom. </br>
Get rid of everything you don't need any more. Clear out the whole thing then put in what you want to put in. </br> 
In react, there are functional and class components. We are ONLY focusing on class components for 301. type in :import React from 'react'; </br>
there is one mandatory metho you MUST define is render:</br>
render(){</br>
</br>
}</br>
All components MUST be named with capital letters to start. </br> 
Must have a render method, and inside of the render method you MUST have a return. </br>
When returning multiple lines in JSX you must wrap the JSK in parenthesis. </br> 
Fragment: Special to react, it ONLY exists in React. It does not actually exist on the DOM or have CSS properties. Its sole purpose is to be a parent element for whatever is inside of it. </br>
You then need to export the header so that you can IMPORT it into the app.js</br>
When importing, you have to give it a path. so ./Header.</br>
Always copy and paste instead of typing.</br>
#### control+D will grab all instances of what you have highlighted, and it will then let you change all things named that at the same time. </br>
DRY: Dont Repeat Yourself </br>
Create a component, so make a snack.js file. </br>
To get out of JSX, use curly brackets to go back to JS. </br>
When we render a new component, we have access to contextual this. So we use this to access the snacks property using props. You then name the property you want to get the value of. so this.props.description gives you the description property of whatever "this is". </br>
Create react app will create a readme, and gitignore, and a readme. SO DONT MAKE YOUR OWN.</br> 
master=main</br>
You want to work on a branch, because what you are turning in as your submission the pull request for this assignment. </br> 


## 4/25 lecture notes 

Tonight is all about code challenges</br>

Did a lab revie about 36 minutes into lecture. </br>


Map is just like forEach, but it creates a new array for you instead of returning absolutely nothing. </br>

Filter() array method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function (this is called a conditional). So if the element of the array passes the test and returns true, it is added to the new array. </br>
