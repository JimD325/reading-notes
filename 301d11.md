- You can expect to use .reduce, .map, .filter, .join, .forEach for the code challenge. 
- No partner Power Hour on saturday either. DO NOT DO IT. 
- Can do partner power hour from a talk that is in the past, but if you do that make sure you mention which one it was when you turn it in. 
- Now on to MongoDB. This is a big topic. Class 11 is when we start the READ part of CRUD.

- So we are storing books inside of our database. 
- use that starter code. 
- install the dependencies!! npm i that shit in terminal to install.

# Day 11 Reading Notes 

[SQL vs NoSql](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

### 5 differences between SQL and NoSql
SQL	NoSQL
| SQL      | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Relational Database     | Non-relational Database       |
|  Table Based  | Document based        |
| Pre-defined Schema     | Dynamic Schema       |
| vertically scalable   | Horizontally Scalable        |
| Uses structured query language (SQL)      |  queries are based on collection of docs       |

 	 
 	 
 	 
1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Give a real world example. MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres, and Ms-SQL.
2. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Give a real world example. MongoDB, Big Table, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDb. 
3. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSql, reading specifically mentions that it is preferred for a large data set ie Big Data.
4. Which type of database is best for scalability? SQL best for vertical scalability, ie upgrading the server in use. NoSql is better for horizontal scaling, ie adding more servers to database infrastructure.

1. What does SQL stand for? structured query language
2. What is a relational database? one which stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with? Tables
4. What is a ‘schema’? defined by a field, it determines what entry (or record) can go into the table. all records in table MUST follow the schema, so that the item has name, description, and price, but wouldnt have a favorite food. 
5. What is a NoSQL database? think MongoDB. Mongo is short for humongous, because its meant to store large amounts of data.  
6. How does it work? We have collections isstead of tables, and collections have documents instead of tables, documents do NOT need to use the same schema. 
7. What is inside of a Mongo database? Collections of documents, in which documents do not need to fit a specific schema as they do in SQL. 
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. MongoDB, because data does NOT need to follow the same schema. 
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? less predictable layout of data, It is more difficult to handle MANY write requests.
