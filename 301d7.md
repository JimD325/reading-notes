# Day 7 Reading Notes

[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)<br/><br/>


- Who is Roy Fielding? Heped write the first web servers and did reasearch on how the internet works the way it does. <br/>
- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? Because not all of the machines can support the newer methods. 
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? HTTP REST
- What does a GET do? Retrieves information
- What does a POST do? create a new subordinate resource, such as a file which is inside of a directory. 
- What does PUT do? Updates an existing resource, only use if you are replacing the entirety of the resource.  
- What does PATCH do? Makes a partial update to a resource. 

# Day 7 Lecture Notes 5/12

Starting on saturday we will learn how to build a back end. So we are going to turn our computer into a server. lets gooooo. <br/>

For Today, just a review of the last class. Learning array and string methods today. <br/> 

Java and C# is a strictly typed language, meaning you have to tell it what data type to use. <br/> 

- API = application programming interface, you can ask for data and get it back. <br/>
- Thunder Client: VS code extension for testing APIs. <br/>
- .env stands for environment, and it stores the API key. IS NOT uploaded to github when you push it up. <br/>
- Axios: What actually sends the request to the server for the APIs and then carries that data back to the user. <br/>
- async: makes a function that returns a promise, makes the code asynchronous<br/> 
- await: makes a function that waits for the promise. tells the code where to wait for the promise to be returned. <br/> 
- Asynchronous Code: Hop out of the regular flow of code and continue on, Once the promise comes back from the API, that data gets plugged back into where the script currently is running. <br/>
- API keys: a protection for APIs from most attacks, its like a password to access the API data. <br/>
- Queries: the data you are requesting from the API. <br/>
- WRRC: Web Request Response Cycle. <br/>
- Request: object that Axios brings the query to our API in. request.query<br/>
- Response: also an object, it is brought back from axios and stores the data from the API, typically called response.data. 
- Zayah volunteers for Lab code review at 706P. <br/>
- Going over error handling at 722PM. <br/>

### Pirates of the Carribean 

- Going over the split method for arrays. give you a new array of strings, split at each point where the separator occurs in the given string. Separator characters are removed as the string is being slpit, and the original. it returns a new array with all of the values you put into split REMOVED. <br/> 
- split
- slice
- join
- can use a negative index to start from the end of the array. 
- splice: Must give it a start number. 

Demo is in readme for class 7<br/>

# Day 7 Lecture Notes 5/14<br/>

- What is a server: a peice of computer hardware/software thatprovides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client-server model. 
- what is express: the most popular node web framework, and is the underlying for a number of other node web frameworks. has a set of common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and create custome responses for different HTTP paths. 
- node.js is the platform where we write JS to run, express is the environment in which we build our server. If you want to do more than just READ, you will need to use express. 
- You must import express to use it. 
- cors: cross origin resource sharing. "bodyguard of the internet". is an HTTP header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any orgins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. It was developed in response to browser security and vulnerabilities. CORS failures result in errors, but for security reasons the errors are not available to javaScript. All the code knows is thate n error occured. 
1. Why do we need a server?: To connect applications across the internet. It also sets us up to scale our application without hammering the API. Also provides our application a single source to fetch all of the data it needs. You can use a server to do the hard work of formatting data to feed to the front end. Servers may have a better/faster connection to other servers, making it more efficient that the browser doing this job. Also allows us to secure our keys, when HTTP referrer restrictions arent an option. 

at 936 we switch to class readME, going more into depth on the backend, use the code snippets as resources. Goes into DEMO at 940. Break at 944, back at 955<br/>

### Lab assignment 7: Look at Resources in the Lab assignment
- will be building a server that will also act as an API. WE ARE NOT DEPLOYING BACKEND CODE TODAY, but you are deploying front end code. 
- Demo is very similar to the lab for today, starts at 10AM. <br/>

Got lost at about 1042 <br/> 
Break at 1103. <br/> 
Need to go over how to drill down to the needed data for the assignment. <br/> 

json formatter extension for chrome. Filter based off of city name, not the Lat and the Lon. We have 3 city objects, each has data, city name, lon, lat timezone, country state. Data array has 3 objects in it, each is a days worth of forcast data. <br/>

Do error handling for lab 6 and lab 7. Finalize and refactor lab 6 before doing lab 7.  

Came back for more on 5/14. Error handling lets goooooo.
