- Who is Roy Fielding? Heped write the first web servers and did reasearch on how the internet works the way it does. <br/>
- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? Because not all of the machines can support the newer methods. 
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? HTTP REST
- What does a GET do? Retrieves information
- What does a POST do? create a new subordinate resource, such as a file which is inside of a directory. 
- What does PUT do? Updates an existing resource, only use if you are replacing the entirety of the resource.  
- What does PATCH do? Makes a partial update to a resource. 

# Day 7 Lecture Notes 

Starting on saturday we will learn how to build a back end. So we are going to turn our computer into a server. lets gooooo. <br/>

For Today, just a review of the last class. Learning array and string methods today. <br/> 

Java and C# is a strictly typed language, meaning you have to tell it what data type to use. <br/> 

- API = application programming interface, you can ask for data and get it back. <br/>
- Thunder Client: VS code extension for testing APIs. <br/>
- .env stands for environment, and it stores the API key. IS NOT uploaded to github when you push it up. <br/>
- Axios: What actually sends the request to the server for the APIs and then carries that data back to the user. <br/>
- async: makes a function that returns a promise, makes the code asynchronous<br/> 
- await: makes a function that waits for the promise. tells the code where to wait for the promise to be returned. <br/> 
- Asynchronous Code: Hop out of the regular flow of code and continue on, Once the promise comes back from the API, that data gets plugged back into where the script currently is running. <br/>
- API keys: a protection for APIs from most attacks, its like a password to access the API data. <br/>
- Queries: the data you are requesting from the API. <br/>
- WRRC: Web Request Response Cycle. <br/>
- Request: object that Axios brings the query to our API in. request.query<br/>
- Response: also an object, it is brought back from axios and stores the data from the API, typically called response.data. 
- Zayah volunteers for Lab code review at 706P. <br/>
- Going over error handling at 722PM. <br/>

### Pirates of the Carribean 

- Going over the split method for arrays. give you a new array of strings, split at each point where the separator occurs in the given string. Separator characters are removed as the string is being slpit, and the original. it returns a new array with all of the values you put into split REMOVED. <br/> 
- split
- slice
- join
- can use a negative index to start from the end of the array. 
- splice: Must give it a start number. 

Demo is in readme for class 7<br/>
