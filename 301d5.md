# 5/5 lecture notes 

Saturday we are working on our portfolio. If you havnt done the prep work, you WILL need it by saturday. <br/>

Portfolio prep resource is in class 2 readME. <br/>

Todays topic is reduce. Its a little deep according to Hexx. <br/>

C# is a 'strictly typed' language. Means that there are ceratin values that you MUST declare. So strings must be declared as strings, numbers as intergers, etc. You must tell c# what data type your variables are. <br/> 

- event: Something thata user does that triggers a listener. 
- forms: way to collect user input. 
- Event Listener: listens for the event to happen on the element in which it's attached. 
- event handler: the function that fires off when the event takes place. 
- event.target: the event object has a property called target that will target an imput in your form and that target object has a property on it called value that holds the value of whatever came from that imput field. 

This will be the last code demo hexx builds out for us, from that moment on, whoever got stuck will work together on it. <br/>

Hexx asks us where we put the form, I put it in app.js. <br/> 

Hex likes that since you dont have to import all of the beasts into the main. However, if you are unsure of where to put something like this, you should put it high up and then pass it down. Hexx is making FilterForm its own component, then putting it into app.js. Then imports form from bootstrap, and copy/pastes into a form parent element the copy pasta from react. goes over this at about 655.<br/> 

All values from forms come in as strings. <br/>

You cant view all beasts by all horns on your current application, so you need to fix that. <br/>

Now onto code review for code challenge 4. Starts with #10 at 742. <br/>

Challenge 9 start at 8PM. <br/>

Now onto reduce @ 808P <br/>


if name of property can change, you have to use bracket notation, if it is the same no matter what you can use . notation. <br/> 

Replit demo link is on the class 5 readme. <br/>

# 5/7 Lecture Notes 

Hexx inlcuded her 60 pitch into d5 readme. <br/>

Today we are focusing on conditional rendering, and we will work on city explorer from class 6 to class 10, todays lab is all about the portfolio. City exploer is primarily to teach us how to work with APIs. Also working on browser router in the portfolio lab for today. <br/> 

&& in regular JS in a conditional means that both conditions have to be true. <br/> 

After break, went over portfolio from 1025 to 1040 <br/> 

Started browser router at 1040. <br/> 

There has been a massive update to browser router, version 5 is considered stable, but version 6 is the only one that works with other newer versions of react, so we are working with version 6. The switch was deprecated in v6 and we no longer use it. Now we use Route instead of switch.  <br/> 

Get the readME on your machine for this. <br/> 

After we returned from break at 11A, she linked more documentation for the portfolio on the ReadME. Note, they are version 5 and v6 for react router. <br/> 


# Day 5 Reading Notes 

[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

- What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components? Ideally, a component should only do one thing. So separate your UI into components, and then arrange them into a hierarchy such as :
     - FilterableProductTable
        - SearchBar
        - ProductTable
          - ProductCategoryRow
          - ProductRow





- What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? You build the app using only props during this step. 
- Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
State. 
- What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state? <br/>
1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.


- How can you identify where state needs to live? 
  - Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
  - Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
  - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
  - If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.


[Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK) <br/>

1. What is a “higher-order function”? A function which operates on other functions, either by taking them as arguements or by returning them. 
2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

function greaterThan(n) {<br/>
  return m => m > n;<br/>
}<br/>
let greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10);<br/>
console.log(greaterThan10(11));<br/>
// → true<br/>

Line two is telling the function to return true, if m is larger than n, where n is the arguement of the greaterThan function and m is the value being compared to the numerical value of the greaterThan(n) function. <br/>

3. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions. <br/>
Reduce foperates by repeatedly taking a single element from the array, which Hexx refers to as the accumulator, and combining it with the currentValue, which for the zeroth iteration you as the developer can set to a certain value.
