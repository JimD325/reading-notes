# Lecture Notes
We are all Tech Professionals: YOU ARE A Software Developer
MAKE sure to give proper attribution to sources you drom from for your projexts, IE “X helped with Y”. add it to your readme, or a collab.md doc in the repo. 
NEVER COPY AND PASTE CODE
Expectations: Be available during core hours, use video, use mute if you have background noise, collaborate with classmates and participate in lecture. 
Take breaks when hungry and walk away when frustrated. 
15 minute Rule: if youre stuck for more than 15 minutes, that’s the time to ask for help. 

Tutoring is available if you need it. 
Talk to them if there is some reason why you wont be able to make the class time. 
Partner Power Hour: Way to network with people in industry who come to CF and talk. 
Feedback is a gift: Its important to have a feedback loop, where youre constantly thinking about what you’ve done and how you can be doing it better.
Re-emphasis on growth mindset by Steve Hassiden? 
Goes over Emotional Intelligence, Basically don’t be neurotic and have good social skills. 
Being a profession in the tect industry requires much more than just tech skills, so we will be getting some career coaching. So resume will be getting updated, look for the light at the end of the tunnel even in 201. 
201 will cover professional behavior, etiquette, pitch, materials, network, etc. 
Sheyna Watkins came from graphic design and journalism before pivoting to tech. See your background as a strength. 
Canvas Review. 
Syllabus: 
Textbook: go by it, she likes it. 
ALWAYS TURN ASSIGNMENT IN ON TIME, EVEN IF NOT COMPLETED. You can resubmit and get full points after you turn it in, even if it wasn’t done. 
Canvas is in mountain time, make sure you change it to pacific standard. 
Do Reading Assignments BEFORE CLASS, and be sure you turn them in on time, because you CANNOT get those points back. 
Write code in small pieces, this helps you with debugging. Do NOT write massive lines of code without checking for bugs. Sheyna works with a MAC, not a PC. 

RESUME: ONLY change the text, NOT the general format they give. 
Remo Review. 
Put all relevant links for class into the bookmark bar.  
Reviewing VS code, git hub, and other tools we are using in this class. 
Attend A meetup: They want you to find a meetup in your area to attend in person. She encourages you to get an early start on finding a group to meetup with. FIND A MEETUP IN YOUR AREA! Its worth 40 points, and is a very important assignment for you to start thinking about early. 


Now we start code

Tell doc type, then do <html> 

HTML only has two children tags, which are 
<head>
<body>


For usability, you want to put the dimensions of the photo directly into the URL

Inline and internal CSS Styles

We have no CSS in here yet, but there it still some list items showing differently, that is because there is standard CSS put into the HTML. 

Old school internet had all the JS HTML CSS on one file, which we will be going over today. 

This is called inline styles. 

Style is an attribute of the P tag. Putting it directly in with inline styles are not very good at maintaing code, since changes have to go in and be re applied for each tag you want to change the attribute of. 

You can use an HTML validator. Basically you copy in your HTML, and it checks your HTML for any errors. 

Console.log can be very helpful when debugging/checking your code. Lets you know if the code running up to the console.log is running properly. 

*Functions built into JavaScript*

Alert("") displays a popup with a message, and user must address the alert before the page will load. 
Prompt("") Asks the user a question. Must give an answer before the page loads. 
To log prompt, set a variable equal to prompt.
So

let username= prompt(""); 

console.log(username)"

You want your variable names to be relevant to what the variable is. 

Returning Values: 

Some things cannot be returned, ie if nothing is returned by a function, return will give you something undefined. 

Concatonation: 

alert("Hello " + username);

This would generate a custom output based on the user input

Todays assignment. 

Meet up in Room 2 in REMO. 

# Reading Notes 

## HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)

Tags: author says to think of them like containers, which describe how to content inside of them. 

Tag and element are often used interchangeably, but the *element* is comprised of the opening tag, closing tag, ***and*** the content intbetween them. 

Attributes tell us more about these elements, and contain both a name and a value. 

Element types: 
- Body: everything inside of this element is shown in main browser window. 
- head: contains information about the page, rather than information displayed by the page to the user. 

Mostly review from 102. 

## HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup” (p.176-199)

Must specifiy your doctype at the beggining of each page. 

Leave a comment by entering in: <! -- Comment goes here --> 

ID Attribute: any element can carry the ID attribute, it identifiees the element of interests from the rest of the elements on a page. is considered a global attribute, since it can be used on any (single) element. 

Class Attribute: Same as ID attribute, but can be used on more than one element. Use both to apply a premade set of conditions to an element. 

Block Elements: always appear to start onb a new line in the browser window, includes *block level elements* such as h1, p, ul, li

Inline Elements: always appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements. 

Grouping text and elements in a block: use div element and put all your content for it in there. can be useful when wanting to put inline elements in a block.

Grouping text and elements inline: use span. 

Iframe: allows you to have a window cut into your page. you see it all the time when there is a map on a webpage that looks suspiciously like its google maps. need to dictate height, width, source, scrolling, and whether or not it is seamless.

Meta data is stored in the head element, and is itself an emptyy element and requires no closing tag. 

Use escape characters to display those which are reserved by html. 

## HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451)

Header and footer are at the top and bottom of the page, and articles may also have their own header and footer.  
Nav Element is used to contain the major links throughout the site. 
Article elements are a container for any section of a page that could stand on its own. 
Aside elements are used to have information that is supplemental, whether it is used in an article or on the page. 
Section element groups related content together, typically they each have their own heading. 
Figure element is sued to contain content that is referenced in the article
can use a to link around an entire block. 

HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475)

This chapter gives information on a more zoomed out look at website development. Instead of going into technical specifics, it looks more at the art of designing a page before any coding is actually done, as well as knowing the target demographics of your website and details about them. very interesting, but beyond my paygrade at this moment in time. 

JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming” (pp.11-52)

What is a script and how do I write one? 

A script is a serious of commands a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

Actually writing a script requires you to state your goal then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve that goal. 
1. define the goal
2. design the script
3. code each step. 

Goals require tasks to be completed, and each task has steps that need to be taken to be completed. 

computers are very literal, think Drax the destroyer. 
Vocab: Words that computers understand
syntax: how you put together words to create instructions that the computer can follow. 

Objects are things we care about, and properties/characteristics are details about objects that similar objects may have, but just have different values for. 

Compputers use data to create models of things in the real world, the events methods and properties of an object all relate to one another. events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an objects properties. 

Browser/page interaction: 

1. browser recieves an HTML page.
2. it creates a model of the page and stores it in memory. 
3. it renders the page on screen using a rendering engine.
