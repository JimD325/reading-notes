Day 4 Reading Notes 

[Wireframe](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/): A basic sketch of what you want to look like. There are sometimes very in depth wireframes done, we are just doing outlines of them for today. Typically, 
the more people who will use the given site, the more likely you are to have a more detailed wireframe. 

**6 steps** 
1. Do your research, look into prevailing UX trends and do your industry research
2. Reference your research so you can refer back to it. 
3. Map out user flow
4. Draft/sketch, not draw/illustrate
5. add details and test regularly. 
6. Turn wireframes into protoypes

Alot of 101 review. HTML in general is a relatively simple language. 
Opening tag (consisting of the element, such as \<p>), determines where effect begins
Closing tag determines where effect ends. 
Attribute: Contain extra info about the element you dont want to appear in the actual content. 
Nesting: Putting elements inside of other elements. So think bolding text inside of a paragraph that inside of an ordered list of paragraphs. 
Empty elements: Elements with no content.

Semantics: The meaning of a piece of code. Example, the h1 designator in HTML gives a meaning to the content which is "this is the most important thing on this page".
