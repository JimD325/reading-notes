# Day 10 Lecture Notes

### 5/23 lecture notes
- New student named Vida from daytime class. 
- a big part of final exam is debugging, you get a pre-existing code base and have to debug. 
- we use async and await when we are doing API calls to the backend, because we dont know how long we will have to wait. 
- Want to refactor your code when the code is less readable or impure, make code more DRY/decrease number of lines of code, and save on processing power/memory. We modularize to keep code organized. Want to modulate your code on the backend for saturdays lab, once you added the extra API calls, the jerver.js gets pretty busy. so you gotta clean that up.  
- Efficiency Loss/Gain: Big O optimization, how efficient is your code. 
- modularization: breaking files into smaller bites of code based on their functionality. so a `weather.js` for all weather related code, `movies.js` for all movie related code. 
- Single Responsibility Principal: Functions should typically only be worried about one task, they should not do more than one thing, because if one of those things breaks, it breaks all of the functionality of the function. 
- Substandard Programming Patterns: Bad habits in programming such as semi-colons, not having enough comments on the code to keep things visually organized, not having specific enough variable names, not writing DRY code. 
- lab code review starting at 715P, zayah flexes on everybody with the one line in getMovie. 
- luis then does code review at 720PM. He used bootstrap inline styling to get it done. 
- Hexx says to look into the bootstrap component called the accordion. Put the accordion in the movie display. done with lab code review at 733PM. 
- Start code challenge 9 code review at 745PM. 
- Going over Q6 first. Went over zayahs until 751, then switched to Luis. 
- switched to number 4 at 802. 
- Switched to our demo today at 807PM. 

### 2 dimensional arrays
- goes only thru x and y coordinates. a grid like data structure. used to drill down into deeper data. 
- AKA matrix or nested arrays. 
- This same concept is associated with nested for loops. 
- gets confusing at about 813
- demo end at 851


# Class 10 Reading

[Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)

1. What is a ‘call’? a function invocation.
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once? one at a time, since the javascript engine is single threaded.
3. What does LIFO mean? Last in First Out, which means that the last function to getp ushed into the stack is the first to get popped out when the function returns. 
4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

5. What causes a Stack Overflow? a recursive function(a function which calls itself) without an exit point. 

[JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)
1. What is a ‘reference error’? when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared.
2. What is a ‘syntax error’? when something cannot be parsed in terms of syntax. 
3. What is a ‘range error’? when the length is invalid, IE negative. 
4. What is a ‘type error’? when the types of data you are trying to access are incompatible. 
5. What is a breakpoint? the point where the code breaks. 
6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code? iforces errors to be reported to the user

## 5/24 Lecture 
- Cache: data being stored in memory. 
- saves time and money: you get charged when you use a companies API, and it takes time to search the whole internet to do an API call. 
- cache is simply an object that lives ina  module in our server code. we are going to store new API data in the cache object to look up later when the same query is requested. 
- cache hit data requested is in the chache
- cache miss data is not in the cache. 
- go over the readme for todays class on caching, it has the syntax you want to use. 
- `Date.now()` is how you check if data is stale or not, just know how it works, dont get stuck on it. 
- debugging: Typeof operator is useful when you want to see what type of data structure you are working with. 
- breakpoints: freezes the code exactly where you put it, lets you have the stack trace. 
- there is a vs code debugger tool. 
- preventative tools: eslint and rainbow brackets extension (already implemented both of these).  


# 5/25 In class Lecture Notes

- We start can of books saturday, AFTER community night. GO TO BOTH!. 
- Next Friday is a code challenges catch up. 
- Resubmit deadline is June 13th, so ALL resubmissions are due by then.
