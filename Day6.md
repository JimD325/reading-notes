[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
Best known for scrpiting webpages, but also used by many none browser environments. A whole bunch of hypewords associated with it: lightwieght, interpreted, just in time compiled programming language with first class function, its a prototype based, multiparadigm, single-threaded, dynamic language....
Do not confuse JavaScript with Java. They are both owned by oracle but are very different. There are a bunch of links leading into different topics in JS, use link above and navigate yourself. 

[Input Output in plain JavaScript](https://code-maven.com/input-output-in-plain-javascript)

Talks about creating a button to do.... its not clear. Basically you have the input fields, which are the first and last names of the user. The output would be: Hello First Last!  

[JavaScript Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)

3 commands declare a JS variable, today we justare focusing on var. 

var command tells the computer that a variable you picked is equal to something, its the process of telling the computer what x is equal to. 

JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. 

Variables must be identified with unique names, these unique names are called identifiers. 
they are case sensitive, must begin with a letter, can contain letters digits dollars signs and underscores. 

the = does not mean equal to, it means assign this value to the variable. 

ie. x=x+5 in JS, where the new assigned value of x is the old value of x plus 5. 

The equal to operator in JS is ==. 

Text Values are called text strings, and are often just called strings. strings are written in quotes, numbers are not. 
Creating a variable is called declaring a variable and is the first step. you then assign a value to the variable, or you can do it all in one line. Typically, best practice is to declare all variables at the beginning of a script. You can declare many variables in one statement if they are separated by a comma. 

Undefined variables are variables which are declared, but not assigned a value. This is useful in instances where the value must be calculated later or in instances where the user needs to fill in their values. 

The same variable can be redeclared in JS, and it will not lose its value. 

Algebra can be done, and you can mix numbers and strings, but strings will be concatenated. Putting a number in quotes will result in the rest of the numbers being treated as strings, and they will be concatenated. 

$ is treated as a letter by JS. $ is often used by programmers as an alias for the main function in a javascript library. in JS library, $ is used to select HTML elements. 

_ also treated as a letter.
