11/9/2021 

Make sure to do all of your stuff, make it up from yesterday if you missed it. 
Today we are installing everything that you need for code fellows. 

DevelopingTools: 
Text editor, Terminal 

Text Editor: 
Word Processors: Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages, Word Perfect, and several more. 
Code Editors: Githubs Atom (3-4ish years old)
Microsofts Vs Code, Visual Studio, with VS Code is fundamental
Notepad ++
Vim Emacs Nano TextMate
And Many More
The Terminal (AKA the Command Lind Interface
File Explorer Tasks: Find Files, Change Directories, Move and copy files, open files, make new files/folders. 
Terminal Tasks: Find Files/content, change directories, move and copy files, open files, make new files and folders, waaaaay more. Far more powerful than just the file explorer tasks. 

Terminal: pwd= an important command( present working directory) things are abbreviated because old timey computers had severe limits on their available memory. Allows you to look around. 
Ls= list. So when you enter LS it tells you the name of every file in your directory. 
You can also make a new folder on the terminal. You type in “mkdir folder name”. so the terminal and the user interface are all pointing to the same direction. 
Type in clear to clear the terminal. 
To go into a file in UI, you double click. To do it in the terminal, you have to change directory, or type in cd in the terminal.. 
Directory is the terminal name for a folder. 
You can make a text file in terminal by using the “touch” Command. So touch stanta.txt will give a text file with the name “santa”. 
Remove is rm. So type rm X.yz will remove file X.yz. 
Touch adds files, mkdir adds folders. 
Cd goes into file, so cd [filename] goes into file. 
. denotes current working directory
.. brings you back to the previous directory. 
Cd ../../../..
Copy command is cp. Use cp then two arguments, they are the file name/location and then where you want to copy it to. So cp[filename] [destination location]
To go back is cd (change directory) then ..
