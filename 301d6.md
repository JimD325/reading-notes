# Day 6 Lecture Notes 

Warm up: Breakout Rooms <br/>

- conditional rendering: if condition is met, then show this thing. 
- ternary statement: Short way of writing an if/else conditional. will see quite a bit in city explorer. 
- browser router: the thing on the website that allows us to switch between pages/compoents.  will need to use in final project. 

We make either a copy of a value and store it in state, or additional signs that point at the same value. <br/> 

This is a heavily debated concept within programming; how variables and values are stored and accessed<br/> 

### Store by reference, or store by value? <br/>

consider, ye olde humble variable. <br/>

Javascript automatically "cleans up" meaning that it will take unused values out of memory to save memory. <br/>

Primitive types are always passed by value, object types are always passed by reference. <br/> 

Primitive wrapper: only applies to a primitive type and make it act like an object so that you can call a method on that primitive type. <br/> 

Who's on First Class Demo<br/> 

May not need to put in return for todays code challenge. Demo is going to be put into todays README under the daily plan. <br/>
