# Day 6 Lecture Notes 


## 5/10/2022 
Warm up: Breakout Rooms <br/>

- conditional rendering: if condition is met, then show this thing. 
- ternary statement: Short way of writing an if/else conditional. will see quite a bit in city explorer. 
- browser router: the thing on the website that allows us to switch between pages/compoents.  will need to use in final project. 

We make either a copy of a value and store it in state, or additional signs that point at the same value. <br/> 

This is a heavily debated concept within programming; how variables and values are stored and accessed<br/> 

### Store by reference, or store by value? <br/>

consider, ye olde humble variable. <br/>

Javascript automatically "cleans up" meaning that it will take unused values out of memory to save memory. <br/>

Primitive types are always passed by value, object types are always passed by reference. <br/> 

Primitive wrapper: only applies to a primitive type and make it act like an object so that you can call a method on that primitive type. <br/> 

Who's on First Class Demo<br/> 

May not need to put in return for todays code challenge. Demo is going to be put into todays README under the daily plan. <br/> 

New lab project starting today. Will be class 6-10 we are working on it. Will be utilizing 4 APIs for the data to make one big application. <br/> 

- API: Application Programming Interface. It allows two applications to communicate with one another to access data. Is essentially a messenger that takes requests, translates, and returns responses. Internet is full of 3rd party APIs who will happily give us their info as long as we ask for it in the correct way.<br/>  

- Asynchronous Code: You dont know how long it will take API to respond to data, so when the script is reading JS and awaiting on API, so if the code needs the API to run, it will run as undefined. So you need your code to wait until the response is returned before it tries to do anything else. <br/> 
- Need an API Key to authenticate a user to an API. Some API keys are pay to use, and now you are getting into the territory of serious potential security concerns. <br/> 
- Thunder Client: hand crafted lightweight rest client for testing APIs. So its a brand new tool we are going to use, lets you talk to the API and get your data back. It is a competitor to postman, but postman is a separate app that takes up alot of space, and is difficult to learn to use. Thunder Client is gaining traction, and is much easier to use. Its a way that we can test our APIs. <br/>
- Axios: Carriers our request to the server/API. Is a promise based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase. On the server side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses xmlhttprequests. Axios is what fulfills the promise that async and await creates. <br/> 

These terms are also in the class README on github. <br/> 

- Now on to miro the whiteboard. Shows us the web request response cycle. <br/>
- This is the beginning of CRUD (Create Read Update Delete). <br/>
- What she is building out today will be very close to our lab. <br/>
### 5/11/2022 QA

- What goes where in react and with what components? 
Separate your components by concern. App.js is topmost level component. It is the "puppeteer" component. It controls all the components underneath it. State and methods that control state will live here. Main.js if the header and footer components dont need to know about certain data, you can store that data and its methods in the main instead of app.js. Axios calls happen in the main. In city explorer, you can have a main.js, but you can also have your form component. and then in that form you take in the user data on the city that they searched for. another component could be for the location data, so name of the city searched for gps coordinates, and an image for the map. <br/>

# Day 6 Reading Notes 

[An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

1. What is node.js? A JavaSCript runtime built on Chromes V8 JavaScript Engine, and can run it on our computers. 
2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine? It is what allows your computer to be able to properly run javascript in your browser. 
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime? That it provides an environment in which JavaScript can be run. 
4. What is npm? It is a package manager which comes with node. 
5. What version of node are you running on your machine? V 18.0.0
6. What version of npm are you running on your machine? V 8.6.0
7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’? npm install -g jshint
8. What is node used for? NPM is used to install, and node is used to run, tools which are designed to automate the process of developing a modern JS application. ![](https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1516152673node_event_loop.png)<br/><br/>

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. The six reasons given for pair programming are: greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, and job interview and work environemnt readiness. 
2. In my experience, the great efficiency has been the most visible benefit from pair programming. Finding little typos, forgetting a bit of syntax, or avoiding getting stuck on the name of a method which you know exists but just cant remember the name of helps the workflow dramatically, and allows you both to focus on the broad strokes of what you are trying to do and not get caught up so much on the details. 
3. Two developers share a workstation together while they work on a particular problem.
