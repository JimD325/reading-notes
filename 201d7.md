About Salmon Cookies: 
We want all of the rendering being done by the methods on the object. <br />

Render the function which determines cookie sales on each location. <br />
## 3 steps to get an element into the DOM: 
1. create a variable/element 
2. Give it content/text
3. Append it to the DOM. <br />
To append to the DOM, you need two things. 
1. a window into the DOM. (like getElementById)
2. An element that you can append to the DOM 

Just Get Seattle figured out, then copy and paste for other locations. Code will not be dry yet, but we will fix that later. <br />

For the cookies per hour array, push the number of cookies sold per hour into the array. Then add up the indices of the array for total cookies sold. <br />
Need to calculate cookies per hour once for each hour, likely will need a for loop to get this done. <br /> 

She is outlining it pretty well throughout the class, refer back to the video or to the app.js notes she is including. What she did was only for one hour of the day, we will need to do it for 14 hours of the day. <br /> ends at 6:56
