# **Growth Mindset and Reading Notes Directory**


**Purpose**: The Purpose of this page is two-fold. Firstly, it contains all of the links to the reading notes for each class I will take at codefellows. This will be a reference to use when looking back at previous courses (or different days in the same course). It also serves as a personal reminder to always try to maintain a growth mindset.

A growth mindset is one that enables someone to effectively meet the challenges that come their way, overcome them, and become better in a particular area when doing so. From a growth mindset one should have the ability to truly engage with issues that come their way. This means giving it their full effort and attention, and not letting bumps in the road keep them from where they are trying to go. The graphic given with the reading is a great way to visualize the difference between the growth and fixed mindset, and includes mental notes to tell yourself when certain issues arise.

### Growth Mindset Reminders
1. Eagerly take on new tasks
      There is no way to grow without doing things you havn't done before. Take the first step towards growing outside of your comfort zone. 
   
2. View criticism as valuable feedback, not as a personal attack. 
     Many people have worked on similar projects to you in the past. Use their criticism as a source of information on how you can do better. 
   

3. Dont Quit, DO IT
 Everyone feels like giving in from time to time. Resist that urge. Take a break if you need to, but perservere in the task until it is done.
