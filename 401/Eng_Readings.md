- Placing a hire value on the time you spend means focusing your efforts on whats truly important to you, not distractions like social media or doing busy work for others. 
- Being busy is a sign of weakness, and it takes discipline to avoid becomming busy.  
- Be focused, NOT busy. 
- Indeed the state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, but the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations…If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own.
- Do not tolerate busywork or distraction. Have a clear vision to your goal, and work to get there every single day. 
- Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.
- Extreme results requires extreme focus. 
- As you think, so you are. 

### Think like a programmer
<br>

- Thinking like a programmer is looking for a more effective way for problem solving. 
- A systemless approach to problem solving looks like: 
  - Try a solution.
  - if that doesn’t work, try another one.
  - If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
- Instead, have a framework and practice using it. 
- For the framework, understand what is being asked and explain it in plain english. 
- Plan your solution
- Break the problem into smaller problems and defeat them in detail. Reduce the problem as much as you need to in order to avoid getting stuck at step 0. 
- If Stuck, Debug(find out what you actually told the computer to do instead of what you think you told it to do), reassess, and research. 
### Solving Problems
<br>

- Measure twice, cut once. 
- Understand the problem fully before diving in. 
- Dont oversolve the problem on the first iteration. 
1. Read the problem completely twice.
    - You cant solve what you dont understand.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
    - nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually. 
    - check for edge cases 
3. Optimize the manual steps. 
    - easier to optimize at this stage and then make it into code.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
    - capture all the steps you created and put them into editor as comments or psuedo code. 
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

### the 5 whys
<br>

- can be very effective for simple or moderately difficult problems, less effective for problems that have more than one cause. 
1. Get a team and have someone act as the fascilitator, other team members should be familiar with the problem. 
2. Define what the problem is. 
3. Ask why. Answers should be accounts of things that actually happened, should NOT be guesses at what might have happened. 
4. ask four more whys, with each why being one in response to the answer to the first why. 
5. Stop when asking why no longer produces a useful response. 
6. Address the root cause, discuss with team and find a counter measure that will prevent reoccurrance. 
7. Track how well your countermeasures worked. 
### Super Mario Effect

- TedxPenn talk, tricking your brain into learning more. 
- If you "lose points", even if the points are totally meaningless, you have a success rate of 52%, and not penalized have a success rate of 68%. 
- Not paying a price for failure also lead to more by users to get the correct answer.  
- Find the right way to frame the learning process, do NOT concern yourself with failure. 
- The focus is on how to beat the issue, not how dumb you might look while trying to do it. 
- Life gameification. =/= have a postivie attitude. 
- You want it to feel natural to keep going throuhg your failures, just like when you fail at a video game and want to keep playing. 
- Reframe the challenege into a game, each pitfall isnt a failure, just something to remember on the next go round.

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can? 
    - Due to my background in the military and as a chemical engineer, I can confidently say I have worked effectively with a wider range of people than most. This range includes highly educated engineers to those who needed a waiver to enlist in the Marine Corps, the rich parents kids to people who have worked to climb their way out of abject poverty. No one person can be as effective as a cohesive team, and I am confident that I would be able to leverage past experiences working with people from different educational, economic, and social backgrounds and become an effective member of a high performing team.  
2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
    - Based on the readings, I would say the best checklist to follow is to debug your code, reassess how my solution is supposed to solve the problem at hand, and then, failing those two, research the problem in a more in depth manner.
