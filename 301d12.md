# Class 12 Lecture 

- exam preview: is on june 11th, we will have a review that morning, then the exam that afternoon. It will be at either 1 or 2, not sure yet. Well get started code that will have minor bugs, you need to fix the bugs and then add features into the code. She recommends doing the backend first, then going to front end, fix bugs, add features, then bootstrap styling. There will be tests that are similar to the code challenges. Deploy both front and back end, be comfortable with heroku and netlify. WILL NOT have to host atlas database, but will have mongo/mongoose built in. four hours to complete exam. If you are more than 15 minutes after the four hour mark before you turn it in, you fail. May use ANY resource that isnt a person. Get one retake if you fail, apparently its not uncommon. If this happens, you typically go thru project week, then at the end of project week you take the exam again.

## Finishing up class 12 and 13 on 6/4/2022
- today we will have partner power hour, also have a review quiz to do, GET ER DONE at least once. 
- Turn in your resume TODAY, get it done. 
- Get Career Search turned in as well. 
- three ways to send information
- the query is what we used to hold our request from the front end to the backend which axios sends to the server. 
- request.query.data is what is sent by axios. 
- Delete request will be sent in via PARAMS. 
- Params are located right after you endpoint. 
- : in the params means that whatever follows the colon is a variable and will change. 
- mongo gives a unique id for each entry, so each entry will have a unique ID. 
- look up how mongo generates its unique IDs. 
- when creating a new Book on the front end, send to server, then send it to the back end, then it gets its ID there, then new book sent to server, then server sends it to frontend/react where it is going to be stored in state.
- for request body you must axios.post include data in it. 
- Refer to the readme for the class, its great.  
- two methods for request.params: delete and update.
- request.query: Read/getting data. 
- request.body: Create/Update we are sending the info we need to make a new book or that we need to update a book. 
- should put CRUD methods on the bestbooks.js, the highest component that affects what you are actually using. 
- Final Exam help: make a second class of cat in the Cats component. 
- how to update a nested value within a state property.
