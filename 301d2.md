## React: Component Lifecycle Events

![Component Lifecycle Events](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*0saPKFiTUk6W3FYp)

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?<br/>
First thing to happen is render<br/>
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?<br/> 
Constructor is the first step of the render phase. 
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates<br/>
 In order, it goes constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentwillunmount <br/>
4. What does componentDidMount do?<br/>
You use it to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM. <br/>

[React state vs props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)<br/>

Think about props like arguements to a function. <br/>

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?<br/>
  What you would pass to a function, they are what you want your component to initial to or what you want it to render like. 
2. What is the big difference between props and state?<br/>
State is INSIDE of a component, so props you pass INTO a component, while state is handled inside of that same component and you can update it inside of the component. When you change the state in the application it re-renders the application. <br/>
3. When do we re-render our application?<br/>
When we change the state in the application. <br/>
4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?<br/>
Changes to the application such as user generated information/content such as form updates.<br/>

# 4/26/2022 Lecture Notes

### Start

Starts by going over the lab. <br>

Start a new branch <br>

Go to the data.json, look up JSON formatter chrome extension to make it easier to look at. <br> 
API's look very similar like the JSON file according to Hexx. <br> 
the _ infront of the ID (or any other variable) indicates that you should NOT change it. <br> 

You will be adding to your README from now on, where you predict how long something will take you, and then you record how long it took you. <br> 

emojipedia.org is what she reccomends to add heart to the lab. <br> 

Do NOT worry about the "as screen width allows" qualifier in the lab, BOOTSTRAP has that built in. <br> 

For Click counter, even listener. <br> 

What is state? <br> Hexx provided answers to these in the notes for the readME of class 2. be sure to refer to the READMEs. <br>

Goes over update to state about 24 minutes in. <br>

Information always flows down by default from parent the child. <br> 

In react, we must use "className" instaead of "class when we need a CSS selector for bootstrap. "class" is a reserver word that creates instances of objects in JavaScript. <br>

CreateRoot is brand new in react. Look it up <br>

Break at about 55minutes. <br>
Delete steup tests, report web vitals, logo, app.test.js, clear out the link to what you just deleted in index.js. Change function in app.js to class, because we work with classes not functions in react for the course. add the return with the render (you need it in react). <br> 
Recall that the parenthesis in react after the return is what allows you to transfer the fake HTML or JSX to the DOM. <br> 
ALL RESOURCES THAT YOUR COMPONENT WILL USE MUST BE IN SOURCE, THIS IS REQUIRED PER REACT<br>

When in boot strap, go into get-started. You need to install before you can use. <br>

Go to stylesheets. SUPER IMPORTANT, she recommends putting it before your index.JS and put it in after index.css import in there. <br>
Then go to components. Accordians will become more important later on in class, check them out. There are also buttons, cards etc. Cards are easy to implement. USE CARD TO FORMAT HORNED BEAST. <br> She does image in her demo, but use card. <br>

Keyword super allows you to use them from the child component in the parent component. goes into super/props/state about 40 minutes into second recording at 820 pm. <br> 
Then goes over this.handleClick to count interactions with the beasts. <br> 
Dont forget to get the emoji from emojipedia. <br> 
Deploy to netlify, steps to do so are on the class repo in the README. <br>

For bootstrap, remember to install, and then import! <br>
