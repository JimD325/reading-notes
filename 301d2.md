1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?<br/>
First thing to happen is render<br/>
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?<br/> 
Constructor is the first step of the render phase. 
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates<br/>
 In order, it goes constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentwillunmount <br/>
4. What does componentDidMount do?<br/>
You use it to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM. <br/>

[React state vs props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)<br/>

Think about props like arguements to a function. <br/>

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?<br/>
  What you would pass to a function, they are what you want you component to initial to or what you want it to render like. 
2. What is the big difference between props and state?<br/>
State is INSIDE of a component, so props you pass INTO a component, while state is handled inside of that same component and you can update it inside of the component. When you change the state in the application it re-renders the application. <br/>
3. When do we re-render our application?<br/>
When we change the state in the application. <br/>
4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?<br/>
Changes to the application such as user generated information/content such as form updates.<br/>
