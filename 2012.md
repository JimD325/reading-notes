Then we are doing a code review of the busMall project. <br/>

If else statement for max clicks to ensure that more items dont render.

This saturday She will be unlocking the final exam for the test. The Review quiz is due next monday, she expects you to have gone over all your review quizes and had perfect 10s on all of them. MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS! many of those questions will show up in some form or another in the final exam. Final exam should take you about an hour or so. <br/> 

Deadline to be able to redo assignments is on 1/30. Project week starts on the 31st. At that point you must have at least an 80% overall grade to get into project week. <br/> 
You must have an overall grade of 90% to pass the class. <br/>
60 second personal pitch: This is your elevator pitch <br/>

Now, back to the GOATS. We are adding a chart to our busMall Project. We have to update the algorithm to generate three UNIQUE products for each iteration. So products seen on turn 1 are not seen on turn 2. <br/>

starts at 6:44

Will use ChartJS(imported from CDN) to display the vote totals and the number of times was viewed in a bar chart format. Will also be using the canvas Tag. She recommends putting canvas inside of the div since it will be easier to style it that way. 

To render bar chart, you put the config directly in the renderChart Function. For the data, you have to attached the number of likes/views for each of your products. The grid you have put the chart in may limit the size of the chart. So to get it to fit properly you need to alter your CSS. <br/>

Use two datasets, one for views and one for votes in the renderChart function. <br/> 

The chart must be rendered at a certain time so that the values for name likes and views can match up with the actual input from the user. <br/>

The chart you made should look different from the base, read the chart.js documentation and play around with it. <br/>

Think about how to use chart JS in your final project. But if there are any other libraries you want to use on the final project you need to clear them through Sheyna. Google fonts, font awesome, and chart JS are fair game though.  

### 1/20/2022 Lecture Notes 

She really wants you to read the google article on building the perfect team. There will be a class discussion, so don't forget to read the whole article. <br/>

On saturday, there will be a Partner Power Hour, a speaker talking about security. <br/>
