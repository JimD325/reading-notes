Template literal in JS is discussed. It can work similar to concatonation, just looks a little easier. We will be using it alot moving forward. 

push will add something to your array, while pop will take away the last item. the .pop will store the value which was taken off, so you can work with it if you save it as a variable.

Today the focus will be on functions. 

Dont use let to declare functions just yet. If you use let you have to invoke it after the declaration. <br />
Use return or break in a place where the code is finished. Return is basically a break. <br />
When writing in template literal, you can put in tabs, spaces, and enters to display the text message. <br />

The order you put into a function matters, anything with default values go at the end.

# Reading number 4 

### Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)

Function: consist of a series of statements thath ave been grouped together because they perform a specific task. <br />
Method: Same as a function, except that hey are created inside of, and are a part of, an object. <br />
Object: A stand alone entity with both properties and type. Browsers also have built in objects. <br />
Functions can be set to run only when some input from the user prompts it instead of right when the webpage opens up. <br />
Functions should be given a name if you want to invoke or call them later. <br />
Information that is needed by a function to perform its function (lol) is called a parameter. <br />
The response from a function is called its return value. <br />
when you enter in a functions name, the value (code block) will run. <br />
Functions are created by giving it a name and then writing ther statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces, this is called DECLARATION.<br />
Basically, functions are a shorthand for a segment of code that you may like to reuse throughout the JS code. <br />
If a function requires information to be input and run properly, include the names of the parameters inside the (). This sets them as variables to be used only within that function. <br /> 
When calling those functions, just include the values of those variables inside the parenthesis<br />
Can return single values out of a function, or multiple values if you have the output go into an array. Check page 95 <br />

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming 
<hr />
Pair progrmmaing is a way for two developers to share a single workstation to interactive tackle a coding task together. 
<br />
There are two roles, Navigator and Driver. <br />
Driver is the one with hands on the keyboard, while the Navigator guides the driver, but does NOT input anything. <br />
This allows you to work on listing, speaking, reading, and writing the technical jargon required to understand how to effectively communicate about code<br />

### Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
can be used to link to other sites using an absolute URL, or another page on the same site using a relative URL. <br />
Structure: The top level folder is the root folder. Open a file in the root folder, and it will be the child of the root folder, and opening a folder in the child is opening the grandchild of the root folder. <br />
Relative URLS: to get into child/grandchild folders, the relative URL is root/child/grandchild.html. To go up the tree, it would be ../../index.html<br />
mialto: allows you to link an email addres. <br />
Target: should always have a value of blank, and will open the new page in another window. Best practice is to notify the person they are opening a new window. <br />
Linking to a specific part of the same page: Give each part you want to link to a unique ID. Then create a term with a link attached to it using the a element, and put the link in there to the id.<br />
