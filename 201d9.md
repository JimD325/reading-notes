Event Handling and how to use it in the Cookie Project

Partner Power Hour takes place this week; she will discuss her experiences and how she adapted to a career in tech. Will be at 1215 and link will be in Slack. 

Event Handling:

An event is FIREd or RAISED, and Code is triggered. 
- there are many different types of events, but we are going to focus on Click and Submit. <br />
Types: 
- click
- sumbit
- onChange
- Hover
- on page load
- on key release
- on mouse over. 

Key Phrases: Event listeners are code that is triggered when an event is fired. <br />
Bind: when we bind or tether an event listener to the event. <br />

Event Handling: code that runs in response to an event. <br />
React is similar to JavaScript, but it has a larger assigned library inside of it. When writing in react it is similar in that when an event is fired, code is triggered. <br />

We will be using DOM2 level event handling. <br />

She is now showing us what NOT to do; the Old Ways.... <br />
- in the HTML: You dont want to put ANY JS in your HTML. So dont `<article onClick ="handleClick">`;
- in the JS file: Do not do 'element.onEvent=functionName; 
- ex: `button(document.getElementById('button')).onSubmit=HandEvent;`

### Instead, do THIS: DOM Level 2 Event Handling

See JS file in repl Class Folder for her exact notes, my notes will continue in here. <br />

If we have an element, we can add an event listener by DOM element. <br />
element.addEventListener is what you would put in JS. the .addEventListener implies that it is a method, and so we can in that case pass parameters to that method. It takes two parameters, the type of event as a string, and a callback funciton.<br /> 
Arguement: a value that must be provided to obtain the functions result. <br />
Callback Funtion: A function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. She defines it as a function that is passed as an arguement to another function. <br />

Big picture: What are methods? They are functional logic, and specifically functions that are assigned as a property of a particular object. <br />
Helper Functions: functions which perform part of the computation of another function. <br />

In the box example, the code knew which box was clicked. So... How did it know? <br />
- Put one event listener on the "container" of all of the clickable elements within the container. 
two types of event handling: 
1. Event Bubbling: Outer element is doing the event listening for what is happening to the inner elements. 
2. Event Capturing: element is first captured by outermost element, But Sheyna says it is hardly ever Used. 
- We will be using Event bubbling, putting event listener on outermost element to listen to what is happening to the inner elements. 
<br />

First things we need to do in JS: 
1. `use strict` and proof of life. 
2. use three steps to do event handling. 
- Step one: Target a Dom Element. So you want to grab the outermost element that contains your relevant content, which will have an ID of "container". `const container = document.getElementById('container');`
- Step Two: Add the event Listener. This step usually goes at the very bottom of your file. This is the code that needs to run immediately. `container.addEventListener(type of event('click'), Name of callback function(handleClick));` Callback function won't exist yet for this step unless you have defined handleClick. 
- Step 3: callback Function creation. In this case, it needs to be called handleClick. so: `let handleClick = function(event){};` This is where you would put in all the code of JS that you want to run when you do it. 
- She then creates another `const parentEl = document.getElementById('results')`

- She looks into the console, and there a whole bunch of information associated with the event. The elements are selected via their CSS style of selection article#box-two<br />
- Adding a class: Add a class or an ID to generated content allows you to target the generated content from the event to style it.<br />

Form Events: 
1. Establish proof of life. 
2. Go to HTML, and add the form element, add an ID to the form as well. Add inputs to the form element, pass the type attribute, in this case it was text. You should use number for adding the numbers in salmon cookies project. 
3. At this point she can type her name into the box. But the form at this stage isnt very useful, because the user doesnt know what needs to be typed into the text box. If you add a placeholder attribute to the box and then write "first name" or anything elese it will be in the background of the box you type your input into. So instead, add a label inside of your form to tell the user what to put in the box. <br />
4. You should add an ID parameter to the input such as the id firstName for the first name box to fill out, then go to the label for first name and give it the attribute for="firstName".<br />
5. Radio input types give you a bubble to fill in. To make it so the computer knows the bubbles are related and they cant all be selected, you need to give the input radio a name, and giving that same name to all of the possible bubbles to fill it. This way they can only click on one of the fill in the blank answers. <br />
6. Fieldset: it is used to make it absolutely clear that all of the elements of the form go together. 

- Recall, when creating an event listener, the first thing you need to do is to target an element. 
    - so, const myForm=document.queryselector('form')
- step two is add the event listener. 
    - myFrom.addEventListner('submit', handleSubmit);
- step 3 is declare a callback function. 
    - function handleSubmit(){

    }

What I missed: How to create an event. 


Back Online at about 1020 AM, GO BACK AND WATCH FROM CALLBACK FUNCTIONS TO 1020. <br />

To Do the event stuff: 
1. Target an Element
  - select the target elements, so letmyForm=document.querySelector('form');
2. Add the Event Listener
- myform.addEventListener('submit', handleSubmit); We are passing the type of event in the () first, and the second peice is the callback function. 
3. Declare a Callback Function (look up definition of a callback function). 
- function handleSubmit() Need to pass the parameter even to actually access the information.
<br />
Default behavior of a form is to clear the form once you submit it. We dont want that in this case though, so we need to override that. Do that by event.preventDefault();<br />

You can save the information from the form by assigning its value to a variable. <br />

To create a form: 
1. create a FORM HTML tag. 
2. Put stuff in the tag. Take note of what you need to make an instance of an object. In the kitten example we have been working on, we needed a name, about, likes, and images. So we need to have a form that can get all of that information can be added to the page. <br />
3. Type of input you need for a name would be text. 
- so `<input type ="text" name ="name" id="kittenName">` should help you get the name in a label tag. 
4. So in HTML you enter all the relevan tags you want in the form. Sheyna is also including the Label feature in this one. <br />
5. For the image, we have been in the kitten example to pass the location of the image as a string. So we will be FOR NOW doing the same for all image types, passing the location as strings. 
6. Image form stuff
- make a label in HTML; then `<input type ="url" name = "imageURL">`
7. for likes: the likes in the kitten example are an array. So you could count on the user to input the data exactly as an array. OR, and this is what she did, give them multiple fields to enter in the data. 
- Once again make a label tag in HTML, then (still also in HTML) `<input type ="text" name ="fav1>` then repeat this for a total of n likes getting n labels for each of the kittens favorite things. 
8. To add all of this together into a user generated instance, you then make a fieldset tag in the HTML and put all of the form inside of it. DONT FORGET TO ADD THE SUBMIT button for the user to submit. 

Now moving to JS, we go back to the three steps outlined above. 
1. Get an element. In this case we should be getting the form Element which is wrapped around all of the data the user input, since all of the data is wrapped around one event Listener. `const kittenForm = document.querySelector('form')`
2. Add Event Listener onto the kittenForm. 
- `kittenForm.addEventListener("type of event", Callback function), in this case it would be "submit" and handleSubmit.`
Then, still in JS, she moved up and put in a function for handleSubmit. `function handleSubmit(event)`
Do NOT forget to event.preventDefault to keep JS from clearing the form once the user clicks submit.
- To get the information in such a way that you can actually use it, you have to store the value of it as a varaible. `let kittenName=event.target.kittenName.value;` This is all still in JS. `let about =event.target.about.value:`
`let ageInMonths=event.target.ageInMonths.value;`
So you have to store each element of the form that is creating the parameters for the objects you are trying to instatiate with their own variables. 
- you then have to take all of the values from the form and put them into an array. `let likesArray=[
  event.target.fav1.value
  event.target.fav2.value
  event.target.fav3.value
]
- So now we have all the data we need, but now we need to actually create a kitten. so `let newKitten  = new Kitten(
  kittenName,
  about,
  ageInMonths,
  likesArray,
  imageUrl,
)
newkitten.render();
newKitten.RenderTableRow();
- so she rendered the new cat, and now wants to add in ageInMonths to the new article for the new cat. The ageInMonths was a string, so we can put it into number form by using parseInt or +, then adding it the age. 

### Lab 9
- must have a fieldset.
- put form above the table to add additional stores to the table. 
- remember order of operations w/ event handlers. Need an item from the DOM that you can put an event listener into, then attach the type of event and even handler(callback function) for the event listener to work. 
- do proofs of life after each step. 
- validate HTML thru HTML thru HTML validator. 
- can add in a required element to make sure form doesnt go thru unless that element is included. 
- Because you are using a reset, you need to style your forms. Without styling it would just look like a wall of text. 
- FORM SHOULD BE ABOVE THE SALES TABLE. 
- She reccommends getting an early start on LAB 10C. It is GIT practice. Its an individual exercise to practice some GIT. There is a tutorial with sections 1-6, and if you knock out a few each day, you will be better off. It is due next Friday on the 14th. There will be some time on Monday which she recommends that you use. 
- LAB 10B, This is the finishing up of Salmon Cookies. There are no additional requirements, but it is to ensure you have everything done in the Salmon cookies projects. Focus on LAB 9 first, but you want an early start on polishing everything up for lab 10A.
