# Reading And Lecture Notes

### 12/7/2021 Class Lecture

Going over how to create a repo, the walkthrough is also available in the class repository. 

<br />

Dont Forget about the learning journals, they don't need to be crazy detailed. 
<br />
How to make new repository 
Make new, give a relevant Name. Will use the same repo for multiple labs, so dont name it Lab n, name it after the project. 
<br />
Ensure that the repo is public. 
<br />
Be sure to add a lisence to it, an MIT liscense. 
<br />
Repository names should be used in kebab-case, and it should also have a README file. Use main as default branch. 
<br />
Then clone the repo onto your machine using git clone. 
.eslintrc.json
the . before eslintrc means that it is a system wide file, and is normally invisible. 
<br />
use copy to move eslint and gitignore into your about me folder. You have to be inside of the folder you want to copy into. 

Gitignore: makes it so sensitive data is ignored by git. 
<br />
Linter is like a spell check for code. Use it, its very helpful. 
<br /> 

Starting today, we wont really be discussion HTML very much going forward. We at this point are expected to be comfortable with HTML. can use emmet shortcuts once you feel comfortable with HTML. 
<br />
There are default html display types, and they are different from browser to browser. 

use link to set up a relationship of stylesheets and hyper reference the style.css sheet. Then go to your CSS sheet and start working. Dont forget to do proof of life. Be sure to link to the actual path to get the 
<br />
Use the Readme Template from class repository 
<br /> 

Use Github in a similar fashion to a resume, it is the portfolio you are building that you WANT people to see. 

Now lecture shifts to JavaScript. 
When you have JS file, you first have to link it with the script tag. and dont forget your use script at the top and then use console.log to check for proof of life. make sure you use single quotes in JS 
<br />

Logical and && has it so one false value on either side of the && Statement evaluates to false and the code won't run. 
<br />
|| is the logical or. either value being true will cause the code to run
<br />
! is the logical not, and it means the opposite value of what it has. 
<br />
Try and get an early Start on Lab 5c, it can be a doosey.

# Reading 03 

### Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)
***
<br />
This is a review of arrays. Recall that arrays store lists of values. 
<br />Very useful when creating a list that you are unsure of how many items will be on the list. 
<br />
<br />

### Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)
***
<br />
Statements Review: 

IF: checks a condition which, if true, executes subsequent code block. 
IF...ELSE: Checks a condition. IF true, first code block is executed. If False, second code block is run instead. <br />
SWITCH: starts with a variable called the switch value. Switch lists codes that should be run for each possible values of the switch value. This is on page 164-5. Switch value is determine before the code is run, and the variable outlined in the code to vary depending on switch values value should be defined as well. 
<br />
Type Coercian: JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation, ie '1' can be converted to 1 for booleans or mathematics. 
<br />
Weak typing: Script type used by JavaScript which allows for the data type for a value to change.
<br />
Strong typing: Data type is specified by you and will not change. 
<br />
To address issues with this, use strict operators to ensure the data type isnt changing. <br />
Everything is truthy in JavaScript except for:
* the flase boolean
- the number zero
- an empty string
- NaN
- a variable with no value assigned to it.<br />

A Unary operator returns a result with just one operand.<br />
you can check for the an element is found by using an IF ELSE statement, returning X if it is found and Y if it is not. <br />
Due to type coercian, strict operators results in fewer unexpected values than == and != do. <br />
Logical operators read left to right. <br />
 ***
 ### Loops

Loops Check a condition. If loop is true, code will run. The condition is then checked again and if still true, code runs again... and again until condition is false. <br />
FOR: The condition which is checked is a counter, which is used to tell how many times the code should be run. <br />
While: Condition is something OTHER THAN a counter, and the code will continue for as long as the condition is true. <br />
DO WHILE: condition is something OTHER THAN a counter, and the code will continue for as long as the condition is true. HOWEVER the code will always run at least once, regardless of the truefullness of the condition. <br />
For Loops Continued: 
- Condition (ie how many times something is counted) may also be a variable that holds a number.
- Variable counter starts at given value, and changes on each loop by the increment (or decrement) you gave it.
- Variable (i) may be used inside of the loop itself, such as console.log the counter number. 
- when condition is no longer true, the loop ends and script moves to next line of code. 
<br />
Key Loop Concepts 
- Break is a keyword which causes the termination of the loop.
- continue is a keyword that stops the current iteration, and then update and check the condition to see if it is stil true. 
- Loops are helpful with arrays if you want to run the same code for each item in the array. and example is on page 175. 

### Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
***
Types of lists (other than ordered and unordered)
1. Definition Lists: created using d1 element. Inside of the d1 element, you will have the dt telement which is used to contain the term being defined and the dd element which contains the definition itself. 
2. Nested lists: literally just a list inside of the list. 

### Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
---
Deals largely with controlling the dimensions of your boxes, creating borders around them, setting the margins and padding for them, and showing/hiding the boxes. 
<br />
% sizing sizes the box as a percentage of the browser window or the size of the box the box is nested inside of. <br />
Width and height can be set to a minumum and a maximum<br />
if the content of the box is larger than the box itself, you can set overflow: to either hidden; or scroll;<br />
Border: separates the edge of one box from another<br />
Margin: Distance between two adjacent boxes<br />
Padding: Distance between the border of a box and its content<br />

Border width: can be set to pixels or thin/medium/thick. For different sides of the box you label 4 diff pixel values, going top-right-bottom-left. Also goes for border color. <br />
Border Style: What the border looks like, there are several pre made styles.<br />
**border**: this one property allows you to, in order, specify the width, style, and color of border in one property. <br />
Similar functionality in terms of width for padding and margin, can be set with pixels, as well as top right bottom left rotations when entering. 
**centering** If you want to center a box on the page or inside of its parent box, you need to set the width for the box on the right and left to auto. <br />
Display proerty: allows you to turn inline element into a block level element and vice versa, can also be used to hide stuff. <br />
Inline-block causes a block level elemeent to flow like an inline element, while retaining other features of a block level element. <br />
using display: none will hide the element from the page<br />
Visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users, BUT it leaves a space where the element would have been. <br />
Border-image Property: displays an image as the border of any box. requires:
- image url
- where to slice the image 
- what to do with the straight edges. Can either Stretch, repeat, or round. <br />

Box Shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around the box. Includes, in order, H offest, V offset, blur distance, and spread of shadow. <br />
Border Radius: allows you to create rounded corners on a box. can designate corners in the T/R/B/L fashion.<br />
Entering in pixels or em establishes what the radius on that turn is.
